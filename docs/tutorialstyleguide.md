# Tutorial Style Guide

## Introduction

Introduce the tutorial’s goal and any new concepts that will be introduced. This should be at least two sentences, but can be as long as necessary to adequately summarize the document’s objectives. End this section with links to prerequisite topics and articles that give useful/necessary context for the tutorial.

## Body Paragraphs

Divide the body according to the tutorial’s high-level steps, using header level two (##) for section titles so that readers can easily click around to the section(s) they find most relevant. These sections should be coherent on their own, but each successive section should build upon the previous one to maintain a nice flow throughout the document.

Body paragraphs should fall into one of two categories: conceptual explanations and stepwise explanations. Conceptual explanations introduce new topics or explain how certain features relate to others. Use stepwise explanations anytime you’re asking readers to follow certain steps to achieve a stated outcome.  

## Conclusion

Conclude each tutorial with a suggestion about what to do/learn next (if applicable) and link to the three or four best related documents.

## Media

Most tutorials will have some type of media to accompany it (i.e. png, gif, or a linked YT video) but resist the urge to go overboard – less is usually more. Images are typically only needed when documenting something abstract about the UI or showing the results of a step. Use a gif in place of photos only to display multiple actions or mouse clicks introduced in the same step.  

Every tutorial should be created with the assumption that it will eventually become a video on the Minecraft Creator YouTube channel. If possible, see about getting a video/video series created in tandem with new feature rollouts and larger documentation projects.
