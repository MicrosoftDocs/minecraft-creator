# Complex JSON Style Guide

## Introduction

Introduce the object in a couple of sentences to a paragraph, outlining its key uses and providing a more detailed description than what might appear in a table that references it.

## Body Content

Content in the body sections should be written in prose style, using complete sentences. Bullets may be used to enhance body sections, but a body section should never consist of a bulleted list alone.  Follow the writing and tone best practices from the Microsoft Style Guide for heading and capitalization rules.

## Tables

Often, tables are the most efficient way to convey a large amount of information. When documenting components, always include the name, description, and type of the properties listed, along with any additional information that readers will find helpful.  

## Samples

The use of code samples is encouraged whenever possible. When adding a code sample, always include the entire object (everything relevant in curly brackets) inside a json Markdown tag, the sample name, and a link to the sample in the [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples).
