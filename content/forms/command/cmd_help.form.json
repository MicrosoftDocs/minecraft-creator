However, since there are so many, they have been divided up into several pages, where you are shown only one page at a time. Supplying a page number will change which page of commands to show.\n\nWhenever you want to know the usage and all of the syntaxes of a command, you can use /help followed by the name of the command. This can be helpful if you want an overview of the command.\n\nSee more in the [Popular Commands documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/minecraft/creator/documents/commandspopularcommands#help).",
