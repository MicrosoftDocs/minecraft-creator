To work with custom stairs, requires the use of `minecraft:vertical_half` and `minecraft:cardinal_direction` or `minecraft:facing_direction` which can be set through the `minecraft:placement_direction` block trait. Custom blocks without this component will default to unit cube support.\nExperimental toggles required: Upcoming Creator Features",
