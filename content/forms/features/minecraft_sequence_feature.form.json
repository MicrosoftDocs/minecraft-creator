For example, a tree feature is placed at (0, 0, 0) and places blocks up to (0, 10, 0). The next feature in the sequence begins at (0, 10, 0). Succeeds if all features in the sequence are successfully placed. Fails if any feature in the sequence fails to be placed. Features that have not yet been placed at the time of failure are skipped.",
