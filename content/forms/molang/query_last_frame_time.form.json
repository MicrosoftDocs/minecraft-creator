'query.last_frame_time' (or the equivalent 'query.last_frame_time(0)') will return the frame time of the frame before the current one.  'query.last_frame_time(1)' will return the frame time of two frames ago.  Currently we store the history of the last 30 frames, although note that this may change in the future.  Passing an index more than the available data will return the oldest frame stored.",
