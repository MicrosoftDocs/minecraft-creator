    "description": "Adds component groups to the current entity. These groups must be defined in the 'component_groups' section of the file. As entities can only have one component of each type active, any components in a group that is being added will replace previously added components. Additionally, adding a component group that is already active will cause those components to be re-initialized. For some types of components like minecraft:is_baby, re-initializing an already active component has no effect, but for other component types the associated logic will start over. For example, an already-added minecraft:timer that is added again will start its timing logic over.",
