  "description": "Will queue a slash command or a series of slash commands set in an array to trigger at the end of the tick. Due to being queued as opposed to triggering instantly, any immediate side-effects of the command may not be observable by other molang queries, commands, or scripts until later in the tick. Note that commands executed via queue_command are guaranteed to run in order with respect to other queued commands. Additionally, if an entity is removed before a queued command has the chance to execute, for example removed on the same tick that the command was queued, the command will not execute.",
