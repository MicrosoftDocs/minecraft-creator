This means\r\n\t\tfilters in later entries in a 'sequence' array won't see changes from earlier in that array.\r\n\t\tIt also means that when one entity sends an event to another entity, it could take effect on the same\r\n\t\tgame tick or on the next tick, depending on whether the target entity has already been updated.\r\n\t",
