This happens every tick while in use, in a straight line along the user's view vector, with damage computed based on both the user's and the target's velocity projected onto the view vector (via a dot product). The more the user and target move toward each other, and the more this movement is aligned with the user's view vector, the higher the damage. After \"damage_multiplier\" and \"damage_modifier\" are applied, the resulting damage is floored to the nearest lower integer.",
