# Name of Behavior

A quick summary of what the behavior does. Taken from the autogenerated docs, but can be fleshed out.

> [!NOTE]
> If the behavior is a requirement for another behavior, use a NOTE alert with hyperlinks to each behavior.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If the behavior requires another behavior in order to work properly, use an IMPORTANT alert with hyperlinks to each behavior.

## Parameters

Use a table with four titles to match the autogenerated docs. If the name is a definition of an argument ,such as melee_fov, add a hyperlink to the definition.

|Name |Default Value  |Type  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|

### Nested Table

If the table has a nested table, pull the table out as a definition, link to the table as a definition and place a snippet of the table below.

## Example

This is a custom example written by the developers/Technical writers of a fleshed out behavior using as many of the arguments available.

```json
"minecraft:behavior.foo":{
    "priority": 2,
    "parameterA":true,
    "parameterB":42,
}
```
