# Tips For Using This Site

Here are some very common links and tips for using the content available here.

## Search

You may have noticed that the Search bar, at the top of the page, searches across all Microsoft Learn content, which may not be your intention.

If you want to search only within Minecraft content, use (and potentially bookmark!) [https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?scope=Minecraft](https://learn.microsoft.com/search/?scope=Minecraft), which is a more narrowly scoped version of search focused solely on learn.microsoft.com Minecraft content.

## Experimental vs. Stable documentation

This documentation set is divided into "Stable" and "Experimental" views via the "Minecraft Bedrock Stable APIs"/"Minecraft Bedrock Experimental APIs" picker you can see on this page. The "Experimental" view contains more reference documentation about experimental capabilities, particularly in the area of script APIs. To see full documentation about experimental features and APIs, select the [Minecraft Bedrock Experimental APIs option](./MoreInfoSources.md?view=minecraft-bedrock-experimental).

## More Sources of Information

Don't see what you're looking for here? Check the list of [broader information sources](./MoreInfoSources.md) amongst sample repositories and community information services.
