# Introduction to Resource Packs

Before building your first Add-On for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, you will need to create a pack to hold your custom content. There are two types of packs that a creator can make: resource packs and behavior packs. A **resource pack** is a folder structure that will contain all of your custom models, sounds, textures, and other custom content. This tutorial will change the color of dirt to a bright green.

In this tutorial, you will learn the following:

> - How custom textures are loaded into Minecraft.
> - The concept of **Pack Stacking** when working with Add-On content.

## Requirements

We recommend completing the following be completed before beginning this tutorial:

- [Getting Started with Add-On Development](GettingStarted.md)

## Building the Resource Pack

For Minecraft to find and use your resource files, you have to set up the folders and files in a particular structure. This tutorial will guide you through creating this folder and file structure.

### Create a folder

In this section, you will start by creating a folder called **My_RESOURCE_Pack**. Well, you don't have to call it that. In fact, you can name this folder anything you want, but the other folders have to be named exactly like this tutorial says so that Minecraft knows where to look.

1. Open your **com.mojang** folder.
1. Double-click the **development_resource_packs** folder to open it.
1. Add a new folder and name it **My_RESOURCE_Pack**.
1. Double-click the ***My_RESOURCE_Pack** folder to open it.
    ![image of newly created folder with a single Folder called My_RESOURCE_Pack located in the development resource packs folder](Media/ResourcePack/myresourcepack.png)

### Create a Manifest File

To load a resource pack into Minecraft, a manifest file will need to be created. The manifest file is a JSON file that contains the following information:

- **Description**: In-game description of what the resource pack does.
- **Name**: In-game name of the resource pack.
- **UUID**: Universally Unique Identifier.
- **Version**: Version of the resource pack.
- **Minimum Engine Version**: Required version of Minecraft that this pack will work in.

> [!NOTE]
> To learn more about how a manifest.json file works, see the the Addons Reference [manifest.json](../Reference/Content/AddonsReference/Examples/AddonManifest.md) documentation.

 Minecraft will parse the information from the manifest file and display it in the Add-On section of the game. Inside the file, the information will be split into two separate sections: header and modules. The header section will contain the overall information for the pack, and the modules section will contain the dedicated packages information.

1. Right-click in the Explorer window, select **New > Text Document**.
1. Name it **manifest.json**.
    1. You will need to change the file extension from .txt to .json. If your Explorer window does not show file extensions, you can enable **File Name Extensions** under the **View** tab.
    ![image of newly created file named manifest.json file located within the My_RESOURCE_Pack folder](Media/ResourcePack/manifest_file.png)
1. Double-click the **manifest.json** file to open it in a text editor.
1. Copy and paste the following code into your file.

```json
{
 "format_version": 2,
 "header": {
   "description": "My dirt resource pack Add-On!",
   "name": "My Resource Pack",
   "uuid":"",
   "version": [1, 0, 0],
   "min_engine_version": [1, 16, 0]
  },
 "modules": [
   {
     "description": "My First Add-On!",
     "type": "resources",
     "uuid": "",
     "version": [1, 0, 0]
   }
 ]
}
```

### UUID

Universally Unique Identifier, or UUID for short, is a unique number used to identify different software. For Minecraft, the UUID is used to define a specific pack and to prevent any duplicate software from causing issues. For the header and modules, there will need to be two different UUID numbers entered in each of the `"uuid"` fields between the quotes. You can get UUIDs from an online UUID Generator such as https://www.uuidgenerator.net/.

![Image of UUIDGenerator.net home screen with a custom UUID generated](Media/BehaviorPack/UUID.png)

1. Copy and paste a UUID into the header section. The UUID will need to be pasted in the `"uuid":""` field between the quotation ("") marks to be read correctly.
1. Refresh the webpage to generate a new UUID for use in the Modules section.
1. Copy and paste the new UUID into the modules section in the `"uuid"` field between the quotation marks.
1. Save the manifest.json file.

## Changing the dirt block

With the manifest file completed, you can now start adding custom content to Minecraft. Letâ€™s get started by applying a new texture to the vanilla dirt block. The first part of the process involves creating a folder structure to hold the texture.

1. In File Explorer, in the **My_RESOURCE_Pack** folder, create a folder and name it **textures**.
1. Double-click the **textures** folder to open it.
1. Inside the textures folder, create a folder and name it **blocks**.
1. Double-click the **blocks** folder to open it.

### Creating the texture

Now that the folder structure is created, you can place your custom textures there. This little, green square is an example of the type of file created by the following steps.

![A PNG file that can be downloaded and used in place of a custom texture made in a photo editor](Media/ResourcePack/dirt.png)

You can download it and save it in your **blocks** folder or follow these steps to create your texture:

1. Open up an image editor such as MS Paint.
1. Go to the **File** menu and select **Properties**.
1. Set the **Width** and **Height** to **16 pixels** each.
1. Click **OK**.

You can now design a pattern or any artwork in the editor. To make the green square, a simple fill color was added.

> [!NOTE]
> MS Paint is used in this example for quick and easy access, but you will need to use a different graphics editor for more advanced graphic features like transparency effects or .tga file support.

1. When you're done editing your texture, go to the **File** menu and select **Save As**.
1. Choose the **PNG picture** option.
1. In the **Save As** dialog box, navigate to the **blocks** folder you created.
1. Save the file as **dirt.png**.

### Testing the pack

Now that the pack has both a manifest file and a texture file, you can launch Minecraft and test your new resource Add-On.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pack Stacking** is how content is loaded on top of vanilla content, causing each object that has the same name in both packs to be overwritten by the *latest* applied pack. In our example, the original dirt texture is overwritten by our custom texture.
>
> If another pack that uses the dirt.png file is loaded **after** My_RESOURCE_Pack, then Minecraft will use that one instead and you won't see that change.

Your custom texture will be used on every dirt.png block in the world, but it will not be used on blocks of dirt with grass on them because those blocks have a different name.

1. Launch Minecraft and select **Play**.
1. Select **Create New World**.
1. Under **Settings**, scroll down to the **Add-Ons** section.
1. Click on **Resource Packs** to see all available packs.
1. Click the **MY PACKS** drop-down to open it.
1. Select **My RESOURCE Pack** and click **Activate** to add the resource pack to the world.
1. Click **Create** to create your world.

## Troubleshooting

Resource pack woes? Troubleshooting is a normal part of any development process. Here are some places to start troubleshooting a missing resource pack.

### Your Resource Pack Does Not Appear in Minecraft

If your resource pack does not appear in the Add-Ons section of a world, that points to a malformed `manifest.json` file. Let's investigate it.

- Are there two different UUIDs in the `manifest.json` header and modules section? See the **UUID** section for more information.
- Have you turned on file extensions and paths? If your Explorer window does not show file extensions, you can enable **File Name Extensions** under the **View** tab.
- Double-check JSON curly braces and brackets. JSON linting tools can help.

### Resource Pack Shows Up, Content Doesn't Work

- Check that the `textures` folder is in the right place, and spelled correctly. Then check the `blocks` folder as well.
- Download the [Vanilla resource pack](https://aka.ms/resourcepacktemplate) and try adding your block to the existing `textures/blocks` folder.
- Make sure the new texture file is named the same as the vanilla texture you're replacing.
- Move your pack above others to ensure your `dirt.png` texture is loaded before other resource packs thanks to pack stacking.


## What's Next?

With a custom texture now a part of your Minecraft world, it's time to see how behavior packs alter existing entity behaviors. In the next section, you will add aggressive behavior to a normally peaceful cow entity.
