# Editor Settings Pane

The Settings Pane can be opened via the Action Bar or **File -> Settings**.

The Settings Pane includes these options:

- **Show Invisible Blocks** - Some blocks don't render by default. This setting allows you to view these blocks for ease of editing.
- **Show Chunk Boundries** - Shows the boundry between chunks. 
- **Show Compass** - Toggles the directional compass found at the top right.
- **Fly Speed** - Changes the vertical and horizonal fly speed to navigate around your world faster.
- **Night Vision** - Turns on night vision to make editing under ground and in dark places easier.
