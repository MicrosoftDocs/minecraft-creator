## Requirements

To get started, you need the following:

## Let's Put a House in a Greenhouse

In this tutorial, we are going to build a glass structure and then copy and paste one of the village houses inside it. The glass structure will be made of two parts - a solid block base and a hollow glass top.

1. Launch Editor and create a project with seed: `2123293805289839865`. You don't *have* to use this seed, but it spawns you within sight of a village that has a nice variety of buildings and not too many trees.
1. Close the Welcome screen if it is open.
1. Go to the **World Options** menu and turn the Daylight cycle **off** if you don't want to work in the dark.
1. Navigate over to the village near coordinates (-161, 68, 171). Hint: try using the grapple teleport (Move the cursor to a distant spot and press `G`) to get over there.
1. Find a clear area near the village.

1. Open the Brush tool (`Ctrl B`).
1. Set the Brush Size to 16 and set the Block Type to something solid, like obsidian. The checkboxes for **Hollow** and **Face Mode** should be unchecked.
1. Click the ground once in the clear space to create a 16 by 16 base. If you're not happy with the placement, you can undo that step with `Ctrl Z` and try again.

1. When you're happy with the base, change the Block Type to glass and check the boxes for Hollow and Face Mode. The size should stay 16.
1. Click the center of the base to place a hollow glass structure.

1. Use the Selection tool (`Ctrl S`) to select an entire building and some of the ground around it. Hint: If you don't have a favorite Selection mode yet, try using Freeform to select the ground first and then use the resize gizmos to make the selection big enough.

1. The selection size should be smaller than 15 blocks so that it can fit inside the glass. To check this, look at the Size section of the Selection tool and confirm that the numbers for x, y, and z are all less than 15.
1. Copy the selected house (`Ctrl C`) and open the Paste Preview tool (`Ctrl Shift V`).

1. Move back over to the glass structure and go inside.

1. Click in the center of the base and use the arrow keys to move the Paste Preview outline so that it is completely inside the glass.

1. Click Confirm Paste. Press `Ctrl D` to remove the selection box.

## Let's Put a House in a Greenhouse in the Nether

1. Select the entire glass and obsidian structure with the house inside that was created in the previous tutorial.

1. Copy the selection.
1. Go to the World Options menu, go to Change dimension, and select Nether.
1. Inside the Nether, find a clear spot.
1. Open the Paste Preview tool (`Ctrl Shift V`).
1. Click the ground to place the Paste Preview outline.

1. Click Confirm Paste. If you don't want to paste more glass boxed houses, press `Ctrl D` to remove the selection box.

## Let's Put a House in a Greenhouse in the End, too

1. With the glass, obsidian, and house structure copied onto the clipboard, change the World Option dimension to the End.
1. Use Paste Preview to place the house somewhere interesting.

## What's Next?

Go into Crosshair Mode and place entities into your greenhouse world just like you would in Creative Mode Minecraft. 
Then, go back into Tool mode and unpause the mobs by going to **World Options > Actors > Unpause actors**.
