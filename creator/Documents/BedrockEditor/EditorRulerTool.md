The Ruler is a quick way to measure the distance between blocks in the Editor.

1.	Select the Ruler by clicking the button on the left side of the Editor.

    > [!Tip]
    > Pressing **Ctrl+Shift+R** also switches to Ruler.

2.	Use the cursor to select the starting point of the distance you want to measure.

3.	Navigate to the end point you want to measure and click it to reveal the distance. The Rulerâ€™s measurement field will display the coordinates of the Start (S) and End (E) points, the line's Depth (D), and the total Length (L) of the line.

4.	Click anywhere to deselect the measurement.
