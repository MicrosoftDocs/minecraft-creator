# Editor Terrain Tool

The terrain tool is used to smooth and roughen an area of terrain. Smooth mode allows you to blend sheer or steep terrain into a graded slope, while roughen does the opposite and makes terrain less uniform.  

You can open the terrain tool window by clicking the terrain tool button on the left side.

- **Smooth/Roughen Strength**: The number of blocks around the cursor that will be smoothed or roughened. This value can range from 1 to 9.
- **Brush Settings**: You can use the Brush drop-down to select the shape you want to use for smoothing or roughening. Once you choose a brush, you can configure additional settings, such as the offset from the cursor as well as the radius of the cursor shape.

To use the terrain tool to smooth/roughen the terrain:

1. Choose the **Terrain Mode** and select **Smooth** or **Roughen**. 

1. Choose the **Smooth/Roughen Strength** and the **Brush** in the terrain tool window. You can also set the offset and radius to adjust the specific area.

1. Click and drag the cursor along the ground.
