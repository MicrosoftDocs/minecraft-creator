# Terrain Tool

The terrain tool is used to smooth and roughen the terrain. Smooth mode allows you to blend sheer or steep terrain into a graded slope, while roughen does the opposite, making terrain less uniform.  

- **Smooth/Roughen Strength**: The number of blocks around the cursor that will be smoothed or roughened. This value can range from 1 to 9.

- **Brush Settings**: You can use the Brush drop-down to select the shape you want to use for smoothing or roughening. Once you choose a brush, you can configure additional settings, such as the offset from the cursor as well as the radius of the cursor shape.

#### Use Terrain to smooth/roughen the terrain:

1. Open Terrain by clicking the button on the left side of the Editor.
    > [!Tip]
    > Pressing **Ctrl+T** also switches to Terrain.

1. Select **Terrain Mode** and choose **Smooth** or **Roughen**.
    > [!Tip]
    > Pressing **R** with Terrain selected toggles between **Smooth and Roughen**.

2. Choose the **Smooth/Roughen Strength** and the **Brush**. You can also set the offset and radius to adjust the specific area.

3. Click and drag the cursor along the ground to alter the terrain.
