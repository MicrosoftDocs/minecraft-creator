# Editor Terrain Tool

The terrain tool is used to smooth an area of terrain. You can use smooth mode to blend sheer or steep terrain into a graded slope. 

You can open the terrain tool window by clicking the terrain tool button on the left side.

- **Smooth Strength**: The number of blocks around the cursor that will be smoothed. This value can range from 1 to 9.
- **Brush Settings**: You can use the Brush drop-down to select the shape you want to use for smoothing. Once you choose a brush, you can configure additional settings, such as the offset from the cursor as well as the radius of the cursor shape.

To use the terrain tool to smooth the terrain:

1. Choose the **Smooth Strength** and the **Brush** in the terrain tool window. You can also set the offset and radius to adjust the specific area to be smoothed.

1. Click and drag the cursor along the ground.
