# Flatten Tool

The flatten tool is used to create an area of flat terrain around the cursor.

- **Height Threshold**: The number of blocks above the cursor that will be flattened when you click. This value ranges from 1 to 32.

- **Radius**: The number of blocks around the cursor that will be flattened when you click. This value ranges from 1 to 5.

#### Use Flatten to adjust the terrain:

1. Switch to Flatten by clicking the button in the toolbar on the left of the Editor.
    > [!Tip]
    > Pressing **Ctrl+Shift+H** also switches to Flatten. 

2. Select the **Radius** for the area you want to flatten, then adjust the **Height Threshold**.

3. Click and drag the cursor along the ground to flatten the terrain according to your preferences.
