# Editor Flatten Tool

The flatten tool is used to create an area of flat terrain around the cursor.

You can open the flatten tool window by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + H`. 

- **Height Threshold**: The number of blocks above the cursor that will be flattened. This value can range from 1 to 32.
- **Radius**: The number of blocks around the cursor that will be flattened. This value can range from 1 to 5.

To use the flatten tool to adjust the elevation of the terrain:

1. Choose the **Height Threshold** and the **Radius** in the flatten tool window.

1. Click and drag the cursor along the ground.
