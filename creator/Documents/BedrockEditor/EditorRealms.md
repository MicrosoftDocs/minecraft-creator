# Editor Publish to Realms

Publish to Realms allows you to directly publish your Editor Project directly to Realms making testing on cross platforms with additional users even easier.

The Publish to Realms Pane can be opened via the Action Bar or **File -> Publish to Realms**.

**NOTE:** To use this feature you will need to be logged in with an active Realms subscription. Information on this can be found [here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/realms/how-buy-realm). When using a Preview build, you will need a Preview Realms setup before entering Editor Mode. 

The Publish to Realms Pane includes these elements:

- **Selecting your Realm and slot** - If you have an active Realms subscription you will be able to see your Realm(s) in the Realm drop down. Once selected you can select the specific world slot you want to publish your Realm to.
- **Publish options** - Similar to Export, Publishing to Realms contains similar settings you can cusomize before publishing. To learn more about these details please visit the [Export Pane](EditorExport.md). 
- **Download** - The Download button will save the world in the current selected Realm slot to the minecraftWorlds folder. This is a great way to backup your world before publishing. 
- **Publish** - Pressing the Publish button will publish the current project to the selected Realms slot with the selected settings.
