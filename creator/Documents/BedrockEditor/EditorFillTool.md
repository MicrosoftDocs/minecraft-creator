# Editor Smart Fill Tool

The smart fill tool is used to replace groups of blocks with a different block type.

You can open the smart fill tool window by clicking the smart fill tool button on the left side. 

- **Area Limit**: The number of blocks around the cursor that will be replaced in all directions. This value can range from 1 to 16.

To use the smart fill tool to replace blocks with another block type:

1. Choose the **Area Limit** in the smart fill tool window.

1. Use the hotbar to choose the type of block you would like to replace the terrain with.

1. Click a block to replace the blocks around it with your selected block type.

>[!Note]
> Only contiguous blocks of the same type will be replaced. For example, if you click a stone block to replace, all of the stone blocks within the area limit will be replaced with your selected block type. If there are any iron ore blocks within the area limit, they *will not* be replaced.
