# Editor Workbench Tool

The Workbench tool allows you to quickly toggle block states for blocks that have modifiable properties. These include blocks such as doors, fences, snow, and candles. Using the Workbench tool, you can change these block properties without needing to jump into Cross Hair mode.

Workbench supports these quick action keyboard inputs to change the block states:

- **Left Click**
- **Shift + Left Click**
- **CTRL + Left Click**
- **Shift + CTRL + Left Click**

>[!Note]
> Each block has unique states
