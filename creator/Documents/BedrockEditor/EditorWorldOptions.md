# Editor World Options

## Pause

If you want to pause or unpause entities.


## Change dimension

You start in the Overworld by default. Go here to change to the Nether or the End.


## Test World

Opens the Test World panel, where you can test your Editor project as a playable Minecraft world. You can set the game mode and difficulty settings and use the **Advanced Settings** to set things like **Daylight Settings**, **Time of Day**, and **Weather**. **Show Coordinates** lets you display your current position.

While you are playing, you can press **Esc** and click **Return to Editor** at any time to end your test and resume editing your project. No changes you make while testing will be saved to your project.

> [!Note]
> Available only when hosting a single player world.

- ### Game Mode
    
    Choose Survival, Creative, or Adventure.

    Choose Peaceful, Easy, Normal, or Hard.

- ### Spawn at Current Location

    If unchecked, the player spawns at the usual spawnpoint for that world.

- ### Advanced Settings

    - **Daylight Cycle**

        Normal, Always Day, or LockTime.

    - **Custom Time** 

        This will be enabled if you choose Custom from the Time of Day option.

    - **Time of Day**

        Choose Default, Day, Noon, Sunset, Night, Midnight, or Sunrise, or Custom.

    - **Weather Cycle**

        Toggle on or off.


## Time of Day Settings

Opens **Time Settings**, where you can set the **Clock Type** (24hr, 12hr, or Minecraft Clock) and choose whether the Daylight Cycle will be locked in the current position, always daytime, or proceed normally. You can also set the time of day to one of the available presets or use the slider to set a custom time.


## Navigation Panel

Contains a toggle that shows a birds-eye view mini-map you can use to teleport to the coordinates you click. You can add markers to locations in your world and they will show up as colored flags within your mini-map in **Stored Locations**.


## Weather

This option lets you instantly change the weather in your project to Clear, Rain, or Thunder.


## Practice: Test a world

1. After selecting the options you want, click the Test World button.

2. Your world loads much as it will in regular Minecraft. 

3. Whenever you're ready to continue editing, press **Esc**. From here, you can choose to Resume Testing or Return to Editor.
