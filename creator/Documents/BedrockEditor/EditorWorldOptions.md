# Editor World Options

World Options gives you quick, menu-driven controls for common world state tasks while editing, pausing entities, switching dimensions, testing your world, adjusting time of day, opening the Navigation Panel, and changing weather.


## Pause entities

Toggles entity simulation on or off. When paused (on), entities stop moving and the AI is suspended. Pausing entities can be useful for precise placement and taking screenshots. Unpause entities to resume normal behavior.


## Change dimension

Changes the active editing dimension. Go here to switch to the Nether or the End.

> [!NOTE]
> You start in the Overworld by default. 


## Test World

Opens the Test World panel, where you can test your Editor project as a playable Minecraft world. While you are playing, you can press **Esc** and click **Return to Editor** at any time to end your test and resume editing your project. No changes you make while testing will be saved to your project.

> [!Note]
> Test World is only available when hosting a single-player world.

## Time of Day Settings

Opens **Time Settings**, where you can:

## Weather

This option lets you instantly change the weather in your project to Clear, Rain, or Thunder.

> [!NOTE]
> If **Weather Cycle** is enabled, the weather will continue cycling after your change.
