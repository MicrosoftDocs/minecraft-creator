- **Crops**: Check the box for each crop you want to grow on your farm. Crops will be placed randomly within the farm area.

- **Animals**: Check the box for each type of animal that you want to include on your farm. Animals will be placed in random quantities.

- **Length**: The length of your farm.

- **Width**: The width of your farm.

- **Fence**: The type of fence surrounding your farm.

- **Irrigation**: Check this box to add irrigation channels between the crops on your farm.
