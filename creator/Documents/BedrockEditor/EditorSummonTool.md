# Editor Summon Tool

1. To summon an entity using the Summon Tool, first select the tool to open the modal.

1. Select an entity type in the Entity Type field.

1. Click to place the entity. If the entity is something with random variations like a horse or sheep, you will get a random entity each time you click.

1. With the entity selected, you can use the Rotation field to set which direction the entity is facing. (At least until you un-pause the entities in the world...)
