# Summon Tool

Place entities into your world quickly. Some entities have random visual or variant traits (for example, horses or sheep) â€” each placement can spawn a random variant. While entities are paused, you can adjust their facing direction using rotation controls.

## Using the summon tool

1. Select Summon by clicking the button in the toolbar on the left side of the Editor.
    > [!TIP]
    > Pressing **Ctrl+Shift+S** switches to Summon.

2. Select an Entity Type.

3. Click where you want to place the entity. If the entity is something with random variations like a horse or sheep, you'll get a random entity on each click.

4. With entities paused, you can use rotation controls to set which direction a selected entity is facing. Unpausing resumes normal behavior.
