# Extrude Tool

The extrude tool is used to add or subract blocks of the same type around the cursor.

- **Face Size**: Determines the number of blocks that will be extruded around the cursor. This value represents the radius size from the block face that you click (i.e., if you click the top face of a block, it will add or subtract blocks using the top face as the center of the radius). This value can range from 1 to 32.

- **Layer Count**: The number of layers that will be added or subtracted from the block that you click. This value can range from 1 to 16.

- **Contiguous Selection Type**: You can use this drop-down to set which types of blocks are added or subtracted.


#### Use Extrude to adjust terrain elevation:

1. Open Extrude by clicking the button from the toolbar on the left of the Editor.
    > [!Tip]
    > Pressing **Ctrl+Shift+E** also switches to Extrude.

2. Set the **Height Threshold** and the **Layer Count**.

3. Click the block you want to Extrude from.
