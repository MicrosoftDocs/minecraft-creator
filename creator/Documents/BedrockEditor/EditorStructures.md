# Structures

[!NOTE]
The Structures panel is not added to the Action Bar by default. Click the **+** button to add the Structures panel to the Action Bar.

The Structures panel is the hub for keeping structures that you will be able to move back-and-forth from the clipboard. This means you can quickly build complex scenes by stamping prebuilt structures instead of relying on copy/paste or rebuilding them one-by-one. The Structures Panel is synchronized so if you'll be able to see and use structures that are saved by other players in your world. You can add a shortcut to the Structures Panel via the action bar.

## Save a Structure

1. Select an area in the world.
1. Press `Ctrl C` to copy it to your clipboard.
1. In the Structures panel, name your structure and click **New from Clipboard**.

## Use a Structure

1. In the Structures panel, check the box next to the structure you want to use.
1. Click **Copy to Clipboard**.
1. Press `Ctrl Shift V` to begin Paste Preview.
