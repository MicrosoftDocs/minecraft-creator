# Structures

The Structures panel is designed to hold structures so you can move them to and from the clipboard. This helps you rapidly build complex scenes by stamping prebuilt structures instead of relying on copy/paste or rebuilding them each from scratch.

The Structures Panel is routinely synchronized, so you'll also be able to see and use the structures that other players save in your world.

> [!NOTE]
> The Structures panel is not added to the Action Bar by default. Click the **+** button to add the Structures panel to the Action Bar.
