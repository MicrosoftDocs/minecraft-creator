# Custom Blocks: Geometry and Material Instances

In this tutorial, you will learn more about custom block components, including:

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> - Using Blockbench to design custom geometries and textures.
> - Adding block geometries that are different shapes/sizes than 16x16x16.
> - Using the `minecraft:geometry` component to reference your custom geometry.
> - Using the `minecraft:material_instances` component to set the texture(s) for your custom geometry.

If you haven't completed the [How to Add a Simple Custom Block](AddCustomDieBlock.md) tutorial yet, it's recommended you do that before starting this one.

We've already created a cool die block that you can make with the fewest number of files and JSON, so let's explore the exciting possibilities that are offered by the behavior pack JSON components: **geometry** and **material_instances**!

## Creating custom blocks with resource and behavior packs

*For extra help, follow along with this video!*

This tutorial builds from the Simple Custom Block lesson and uses the same file structure, with one major difference: for these blocks, we will be using custom geometry models, so we'll be adding a **models** folder to the **custom_block_resource_pack**. Here is the updated file structure we'll follow for this tutorial:

## Sushi blocks

We're going to create custom blocks with geometry and material instances: sushi!

### Let's use Blockbench

For this tutorial, we're going to be doing some work in [Blockbench](https://blockbench.net/). Blockbench is a free entity-modeling application for creating entity models in Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Additionally, users have the ability to create textures, and the ability to animate them for Bedrock Edition maps. Blockbench has external plugin support, enabling developers to create additional tools to use within the program. It also has the ability to export models into a standard OBJ format, Java Edition block model, and more.

We will use Blockbench in these tutorials to create custom geometries for the more advanced blocks we'll create for sushi, fish in a bubble, and a giant umbrella. If this is your first time using Blockbench, we recommend taking a look at the [Entity Wizard tutorial](MinecraftEntityWizard.md).

### Geometry in Blockbench

Each custom block has a different unit vector (UV) for the various textures of the sushi sides. The UV defines how the geometry maps to each texture. For this tutorial, we are sharing the texture for the sushi wrap.

As a bonus, the seaweed will be the same for all three rolls, so you can reuse the same geometries!

:::image type="content" source="Media/AdvancedCustomBlocks/advancedblock3.png" alt-text="Detailed view of seaweed sushi wrap.":::

The textures for the individual rolls, however, will be different depending on the type of roll. Here is the salmon roll:

We highly recommend learning the ins and outs of Blockbench as you begin to create more complex and personalized custom entities. For this tutorial, however, we will be creating a blank file and exporting it to our PC, where we can copy our sushi block data.

### Export the file from Blockbench

Navigate to **File > Export > Export Bedrock Geometry** to save the geometry file to your computer.

```json
{ 
  "format_version": "1.12.0", 
  "minecraft:geometry": [ 
    { 
      "description": { 
        "identifier": "geometry.sushi", 
        "texture_width": 36, 
        "texture_height": 18, 
        "visible_bounds_width": 2, 
        "visible_bounds_height": 2.5, 
        "visible_bounds_offset": [0, 0.75, 0] 
      }, 
      "bones": [ 
        { 
          "name": "bb_main", 
          "pivot": [0, 0, 0], 
          "cubes": [ 
            {"origin": [-6, 0, -3], "size": [12, 12, 6], "uv": [0, 0]} 
          ] 
        } 
      ] 
    } 
  ] 
} 
```

Now you can create textures in Blockbench, or create textures in a separate paint or photo editing application (assuring that it matches the size and UV of the geometry).

## Resource pack

### Add the geometry

Let's start by adding files for the sushi blocks to the resource pack.

1. In File Explorer, navigate to the folder **custom_block_resource_pack**, located in the **development_resource_packs** folder.
1. Inside the **custom_block_resource_pack** folder, create a folder and name it **models**.
1. Open the **models** folder.
1. Inside the **models** folder, create a folder and name it **blocks**.
1. Open the **blocks** folder.
1. Inside the **blocks** folder, copy the downloaded geometry files from Blockbench.

### Create custom block localization

Just like we did for the die block, we'll add custom block localization. In **texts/en_US.lang**, you'll add the following for the sushi blocks:

`tile.demo:salmon_roll.name=Salmon Roll`

`tile.demo:tuna_roll.name=Tuna Roll`

`tile.demo:california_roll.name=California Roll`

These lines set the name of the sushi blocks in the game. Make sure not to add extra spaces after the equal sign because they will display in Minecraft.

### Add textures for blocks

Place the following images in the **textures/blocks** folder:

:::image type="content" source="Media/AdvancedCustomBlocks/advancedblock6.png" alt-text="Sushi texture image 1 of 4.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AdvancedCustomBlocks/advancedblock7.png" alt-text="Sushi texture image 2 of 4.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AdvancedCustomBlocks/advancedblock8.png" alt-text="Sushi texture image 3 of 4.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AdvancedCustomBlocks/advancedblock9.png" alt-text="Sushi texture image 4 of 4.":::

As always, feel free to create your own textures!

### Add friendly names in terrain_texture.json

The next step is to associate the texture names with a texture file path. This is done in a **terrain_texture.json** file.

- In **File Explorer**, navigate to the **custom_block_resource_pack** folder and open the **textures** folder.
- Open **terrain_texture.json** in a text editor.
- Copy and paste the following code into **terrain_texture.json** in the `texture_data` section:

```json
{ 
  "texture_data": { 
    "die_1": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_1" 
    },
    "sushi_wrap": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/sushi_wrap" 
    }, 
    "salmon_roll": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/salmon_roll" 
    }, 
    "tuna_roll": { 
     "textures": "textures/blocks/tuna_roll" 
    }, 
    "california_roll": { 
     "textures": "textures/blocks/california_roll" 
    } 
  }
} 
```

### Optional: include sounds in blocks.json

Adding a sound in **blocks.json** is optional, but you can include it here for fun.

**Important!** Because you'll be using advanced geometry and material instances, any rendering information will be overridden by the custom block file in the behavior pack. So we will only be adding the sound here. We'll give the sushi blocks the same sound as mud because they are squishy!

1. In the resource pack, navigate to **blocks.json**.
1. Add the following sound information below the **demo:die** section.

```json
{ 
  "format_version": "1.19.30", 
  "demo:die": {
  }, 
  "demo:salmon_roll": { 
    "sound": "mud" 
  }, 
  "demo:tuna_roll": { 
    "sound": "mud" 
  }, 
  "demo:california_roll": { 
    "sound": "mud" 
  }
} 
```

## Behavior pack

### Create individual custom block files for each roll

Let's bring all those resource pieces together into one beautiful combination in the behavior pack individual custom block file.

Although the sushi blocks share the same `geometry.sushi` geometry, create separate files for each of these rolls so they become their own blocks that display their own unique textures.

1. In File Explorer, navigate to the folder **custom_block_behavior_pack**, located in the **development_behavior_packs** folder.
1. Open the **blocks** folder and create a text document named **salmon_roll.json**.
1. Double-click **salmon_roll.json** to open it in a text editor.

### Create the behavior custom block JSON file

In the file, you will need to define what each of the blocks is.

Copy and paste the following code into your **salmon_roll.json** file:

```json
{
  "format_version": "1.19.40",
  "minecraft:block": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "demo:salmon_roll"
    },
    "components": {
      "minecraft:geometry": "geometry.sushi",
      "minecraft:material_instances":{
        "north": { 
          "texture": "salmon_roll"
        },
        "south": { 
          "texture": "salmon_roll"
        },
        "*": {
          "texture": "sushi_wrap"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Using custom block components

All of this has been a set up to the moment you've been waiting for: custom block components!  

- `minecraft:geometry` defines the model that will be used in the resource pack for this custom block. You will use the identifier inside the **geo.json** file that was created in Blockbench.

- `minecraft:material_instances` has a ton of goodies. It's an object that defines the various textures (a single texture, or per-face) and allows you to specify some information about rendering and lighting. We'll talk more about the specific render methods and lighting options offered by this component later, in the [Exploring the Material Instances Render and Lighting Options Tutorial](./CustomBlockRenderLighting.md).

Just like in **blocks.json**, we can define the various sides of the block that we want to use here. For now, we're going to define `north` and `south` for the salmon roll sides.

The rest of the sides are defined with `*`. This special key defines the default texture that will be used when a texture isn't given for a named side. If `north` and `south` weren't defined, the `*` key would give all the sides of our new block the `sushi_wrap` texture. You must specify a `*` key when you're defining `material_instances`.

## Optional: Name custom instances of materials

There is another cool part of `material_instances` to show off: we can actually create defined variables within the material instances component. Let's see an example using **salmon_roll**:

```json
{
  "format_version": "1.19.40",
  "minecraft:block": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "demo:salmon_roll"
    },
    "components": {
      "minecraft:geometry": "geometry.sushi",
      "minecraft:material_instances": {
        "north": "sushi_side",
        "south": "sushi_side",
        "*": {
          "texture": "sushi_wrap"
        },
        "sushi_side": {
          "texture": "salmon_roll"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Here, we've defined `sushi_side` as having the `salmon_roll` texture.  

Then, for north and south, we can use `sushi_side` as a string rather than a whole object specifying the texture as `salmon_roll`.

Now it's your turn to create the Tuna and California rolls. Feel free to copy this **salmon_roll** file to start from, making sure to change the identifier and the `salmon_roll` texture name to match the corresponding roll.

## Test the block

Let's head back to the test world.

With the sushi blocks defined in both the behavior pack and resource pack, you can test them in-game.

1. Open up the chat dialogue box.
1. Type the following command: `/give @s demo:california_roll`

Now you can place the sushi blocks all over! Note that the smaller geometry means they don't sit exactly side-by-side.

Make sure to test all three sushi blocks to truly appreciate how cute these new blocks really are!
