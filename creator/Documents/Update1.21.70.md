## Entities

## Camera

- Aim Assist - Functionality to target blocks, entities, custom tinting, and custom colors per player no longer behind an experimental toggle.

## World Generation
- Structure loading - It is now possible for structures to load in unloaded chunks.
- /place structure with entity - Entity placement works with place structure command.

## What's Next

Looking ahead, here's what you can expect coming in future releases.

### What's Next for World Gen

- Jigsaw Block - All of the functionality currently available in experimental is coming to stable in the upcoming releases.
- /place feature - A command that allows placing of features.
- Improved Spawn rules - Allowing for customized mob spawning in biomes and structures.


### What's Next for Camera

- Over-the-shoulder style orbit preset
- Camera-relative player control schemes

## What's Next for Blocks
- Data-Driven biome tinting - Supports block textures per biome.
- [destruction_particles](../Reference/Content/BlockReference/Examples/BlockComponents/minecraftBlock_destruction_particles.md) - This represents the particles used when the Block is destroyed
- Isotropic textures - Allows for random rotation of textures (e.g. vanilla dirt).
- Destruction particle - Set a texture that appears when block is broken.
- particle intensity - When breaking a block, defines the quantity of particles that appear.
- Textures â€“ UV locking - This will make it so there is no longer a need to define new geo every time a texture is rotated.
- Loot & destroy API - Allow reading loot tables through scripting. Apply different loot tables through scripting when destroying entity or block.
- Culling rules - A subset of culling rules will be delivered to support behaviors such as how leaves appear when configured in a tree with neighbor rules.

### What's Next for Script API, Molang and Commands

- server-ui - Improvements to sever-ui forms allowing for more formatting options.
- Scripting 2.0 changes - See [Scripting 2.0 Overview](../Documents/ScriptingV2.0.0Overview.md) for more information.
- Custom Commands - Similar to block and item custom components, this will allow creation of custom slash commands via script.
- Custom Components V2 - Allowing block and item custom components to pass parameters specifying properties via script.
