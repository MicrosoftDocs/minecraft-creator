# Structure Blocks Tutorial

Hello. You're about to learn how to use a structure block to:

- Rotate a structure
- Take a structure without the mobs
- Take just the mobs out of a structure (think: chicken replicator)
- Embed a saved structure in the ground (like a fossil)
- Take a cross-section of the world (for science purposes)
- Use redstone to activate a structure block to load in a saved selection (press button, get chickens)
- Duplicate a redstone contraption so you can try variants of it (like to adjust timing and other tricky bits)
- Use two structures to simulate a drawbridge
