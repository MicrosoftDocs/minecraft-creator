# Gameplay Development Journey

Are you looking to design games inside Minecraft? Bedrock Edition provides a myriad of tools to help you, from scoreboards (which, as you'll learn, can do more than just keeping score!) to incorporating JavaScript/TypeScript programming.

The Minecraft Learning Portal has multiple articles covering aspects of game development; if you've taken the [Creator Learning Journey](./LearningJourneyGuide.md), you've encountered some of these already.

## Game development articles

- [Scoreboards](./ScoreboardIntroduction.md): Introduction to the scoreboard mechanic
- [Complete a Monument](./CreateAnInWorldGame.md): Use command blocks with scoreboards
- [Break the Terracotta](./scripting/next-steps.md): Add TypeScript to your game development
- [Parkour Challenge World](./ParkourIntro.md): Bring all the pieces together
