Improvements have been made to rideables.
- The [minecraft:rideable](../Reference/Content/EntityReference/Examples/EntityComponents/minecraftComponent_rideable.md) component now has three new additional fields:
  - "dismount_mode" defines where riders are placed when dismounting the entity:
    - "default", riders are placed on a valid ground position around the entity, or at the center of the entity's collision box if none is found
    - "on_top_center", riders are placed at the center of the top of the entity's collision box
  - "on_rider_enter_event", defines the event to execute on the owner entity when an entity starts riding it
  - "on_rider_exit_event", defines the event to execute on the owner entity when an entity stops riding it
- The "minecraft:rideable" component's Seat definition now has two additional fields:
  - "third_person_camera_radius" can be used to set a different camera radius when in third person or third person front camera. 
  - "camera_relax_distance_smoothing" adds springiness to the camera movement when the camera moves back to its radius after being pushed closer to the player by and obstacle.

Improvements have been made to leashes.

- [has_equipment_tag](../Reference/Content/EntityReference/Examples/Filters/has_equipment_tag.md) - works like "has_equipment" but takes an item tag instead of an item name.
