# Creating a Goblin Chef

![Maker Series](Media\MakerSeriesMakingTheGoblinChef\makerseries.jpg)

This tutorial is meant to be an inside look at how professional Minecraft creators make something cool from beginning to end. Instead of teaching the basics of creation tools, this tutorial assumes some base knowledge of creating in Minecraft and lets us spend more time talking about creative decisions like color choice or finding the right proportions. The goal is to give you direct insight into how pros think while they are creating, and hopefully you can learn some tips and tricks along the way.

These videos feature Mojang 3D artist Peter Sheff, as he walks you through the creation of a custom Goblin Chef entity. Here, we will take you from the early concept phase of the Chef all the way to it being ready to be placed inside of Minecraft. There are three parts to the tutorial: Part 1 is modeling, part 2 is texturing, and part 3 is animating. These videos are 10-15 minutes each, so feel free to watch each part separately.

## Part 1: Modeling

In this video, Peter starts with the fundamentals of creating a new entity. The initial focus is using the 3D shape tools in Blockbench to focus on getting the 3D form of the Goblin Chef just right.

## Part 2: Texturing

Now that the basic shape of the chef has been determined, it's time to apply a set of colors and textures to our new friend. Here, Peter focuses on the process of designing your UV textures including tips, tricks, and shortcuts for using various tools within Blockbench.

## Part 3: Animating

In the animating section, you'll see how Peter animates the basic parts of the Goblin Chef, adding natural animations to the head, arms, and legs to create a walk cycle. You can see how to adjust the motion of various parts by adding keyframes in the Timeline tool of Blockbench.
