# Minecraft File Extensions

A file extension is the series of letters after the period in a name of a computer file. File extensions specify the program or programs the file is associated with. In Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, many extensions begin with '.mc,' as detailed below.

## .mcaddon
A zip file that contains .mcpack or .mcworld files to modify Minecraft (Bedrock Edition); generally used to distribute Add-Ons to other users.

## .mcmeta
A custom resource pack configuration file.

## .mcpack
A zipped resource or behavior pack that modifies Minecraft: Bedrock Edition, typically used to transfer resources between users.

## .mcproject
Minecraft Bedrock Editor's filetype. Files of this type only open in Editor and are capable of containing Editor extensions.

- .mcworld files can be imported into Editor, at which point they are converted to an .mcproject.
- When an .mcproject is exported as an .mcworld, Editor extensions are removed.

## .mcstructure
Contains a Minecraft structure such as a building or natural feature, saved using the Structure Block tool; can be shared between players, allowing the sharing of each other's structures.

## .mctemplate
A zip archive containing the template of a world used in Minecraft.

## .mcworld
A zip archive that contains all the files needed to load a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition or Minecraft Education world, for example .dat and .txt files.
