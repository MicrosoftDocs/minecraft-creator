# Creator Learning Journey

So you love Minecraft Bedrock and you've been inspired to create or modify a world that is all your own. That's a great place to start.

If you've never done anything like that before, maybe the best first step is to prove that it can be done.

**You, as a creator, can add your favorite things to our favorite game by using add-on packs.**

Along the way, you will learn how to use computer science stuff like files and directories, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), reference documentation, and the same tools your fellow creators use to create and test the contents of their add-on packs.

Oh! That's a good thing to learn now: resource packs, behavior packs, and skin packs are collectively or generically known as add-on packs.

## Step 1: Learn what goes where

- [Getting Started with Add-On Development for Bedrock Edition](GettingStarted.md) - Start here to learn about the file and folder structure of Minecraft, specifically, where to put your add-on packs.

- [Comprehensive List of Add-on Pack Contents](ComprehensivePackContents.md) - After you get an idea about where your add-on packs will go, here is a page about the structures and content for each of those add-on packs.

Just take a quick look and maybe use this later when you plan your packs.

## Step 2: Make something

This is where we learn to create a resource pack to affect things in the world:

- [Create Custom Grass Blocks: An Introduction to Resource Packs](ResourcePack.md)

We can use behavior packs to modify an entity, like a cow:

- [Create an Angry Cow: An Introduction to Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)

## Step 3: Make more complex things

You've mastered the basics, and now it's time to move to the next level. These creations are slightly more complex, but learning about them can help you create a more personalized Minecraft experience.

- [Add a Custom Sounds](AddCustomSounds.md)
- [Create an Entity](IntroductionToAddEntity.md)
- [Create a Custom Block](AddCustomDieBlock.md)
- [Create a Sushi Block: Advanced Custom Blocks](AdvancedCustomBlocks.md)
- [Create a Custom Item](AddCustomItems.md)
- [Change Your Look with a Skin Pack](SkinPack.md)

## Advanced stuff that might not use add-on packs

After you pushed through both the basic and intermediate creations, you come to the top of the mountain. These are the advanced-level tutorials and -- I'm not going to lie -- they can get complex. However, by mastering these creations you will bring yourself closer to making your Minecraft dreams into Minecraft reality.
