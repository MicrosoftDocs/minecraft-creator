# Creator Learning Journey

So you love Minecraft Bedrock and you've been inspired to create or modify a world that is all your own. That's a great place to start.

If you've never done anything like that before, maybe the best first step is to prove that it can be done.

**You, as a creator, can add your favorite things to our favorite game by using add-on packs.**

Along the way, you will learn how to use computer science stuff like files and directories, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), reference documentation,and the same tools your fellow creators use to create and test the contents of their add-on packs.

Oh! That's a good thing to learn now: resource packs, behavior packs, and skin packs are collectively or generically known as add-on packs.

## Step 1: Learn what goes where

- [Getting Started with Add-On Development for Bedrock Edition](GettingStarted.md) - Start here to learn about the file and folder structure of Minecraft, specifically, where to put your add-on packs.

- [Comprehensive List of Add-on Pack Contents](ComprehensivePackContents.md) - After you get an idea about where your add-on packs will go, here is a page about the structures and content for each of those add-on packs.
Just take a quick look and maybe use this later when you plan your packs.

## Step 2: Make something

This is where we learn to create a resource pack to affect things in the world.

- [Create Custom Grass Blocks: An Introduction to Resource Packs](ResourcePack.md)

Behavior packs are used to modify an entity, like a cow.
- [Create an Angry Cow: An Introduction to Behavior Packs](BehaviorPack.md)

## Step 3: Make more complex things

You've mastered the basics, and now it's time to move to the next level. These creations are slightly more complex, but will allow you to create more of a personalized experience for your players.

- [Add a Custom Sounds](AddCustomSounds.md)
- [Create an Entity](IntroductionToAddEntity.md)
- [Create a Custom Block](AddCustomDieBlock.md)
- [Create a Sushi Block: Advanced Custom Blocks](AdvancedCustomBlocks.md)
- [Create a Custom Item](AddCustomItems.md)

## Advanced stuff that might not use add-on packs

Now that you've pushed through both the basic and intermediate creations, you've come to the top of the mountain. These are the advanced-level tutorials and we're not going to lie, they can get complex. However, by mastering these creations you will bring yourself that much closer to making your dreams into reality.

- [Commonly Used Tools](CommonlyUsedTools.md)
- [Animate a Block Texture](CreateAnimatedBlockTexture.md)
- [Create a Goblin Chef Entity](MakerSeriesMakingTheGoblinChef.md)
- [Create a Loot Table](CreateLootTable.md)
- [Create a Village with Structure Blocks](StructureBlocksTutorial.md)
- [Create an In-World Game with Commands](CreateAnInWorldGame.md) If your world needs a game in it, here's one way to do that with commands.
- [Non-Player Character (NPC) Dialogue](NPCDialogue.md)

## Next Steps

If you've made it this far, congratulations! You went on an amazing creator experience and came out the other side. Now that you've completed our suggested path, we have good news and better news (this is Minecraft, we don't do bad news here).

The good news is that you now have an incredible set of skills at your disposal to make custom content and provide players with something unique and fun. The better news is that this is just a small sample of what you can find on the creator learning portal. So take some time and look around, continue to create, and always keep learning!
