# Custom Blocks Part 1: The Simplest Block

Minecraft's Behavior Packs and Resource Packs allow you to create amazing custom content for the game. Custom blocks are an excellent way for creators to start adding interactive content. Through this tutorial, you will build a custom die block (don't be scared, that just means a singular dice!) that has different textures and can be placed in the world by a player.

### Creating Custom Blocks with Resource and Behavior Packs

> [!VIDEO https://www.youtube.com/embed/v367NxR2ZsE]
*We even have a video for you to follow if that's your preference!*

You'll be making changes in both a Resource Pack and a Behavior Pack to get custom looks and behavior for each custom block you will be creating. Here is the file structure we'll follow for this tutorial:

:::image type="content" source="Media/AddCustomDieBlock/AddCustomBlock2.png" alt-text="Image of file structure for a completed custom block":::

The Behavior Pack contains the **<custom_block>.json** file that holds all of the information about a block's behavior. It specifies components that give specific behaviors such as friction, flammability, destructibility, and more. Components can also control some visual elements such as geometry, materials, render methods, and lighting.

>[!Note]
> If components are given in the Behavior Pack to control the visual properties of a block, they will override the visual properties specified for that block in the **blocks.json** file. That's why **blocks.json** becomes optional for everything but sounds once you start relying on Behavior Packs more heavily.

In this tutorial, we'll be making a fairly simple custom block. While it is recommended to complete this tutorial before moving forward, there is also a more advanced tutorial on using components called [Advanced Custom Blocks](./AdvancedCustomBlocks.md).

Let's create a custom die block with six different-colored sides that becomes a different color in-hand. Small customizations like this can make a block feel more unique to players.

## Behavior Pack

### Create a Behavior Pack

We'll begin by creating a Behavior Pack for the custom block:

1. In **File Explorer**, navigate to the **com.mojang** folder.

    * Press **Win+R** to open **Run**.
    * If you are using main Minecraft releases, copy and paste the following into the **Open** field: `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`
    * Alternatively, if you are using preview Minecraft preleases, copy and paste the following into the **Open** field: `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftWindowsBeta_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang`
    * Click **OK**.

2. Open the **development_behavior_packs** folder.
3. Create a folder and name it **custom_block_behavior_pack**.
4. Open the **custom_block_behavior_pack** folder, and create a text file.
5. Rename the text file **manifest.json**.
6. Open **manifest.json** in a text editor.
7. Copy the code below into the **manifest.json** file.

> [!Note]
> You can generate new UUIDs from UUIDgenerator.net.

```json
{
 "format_version": 2, 
 "header": { 
  "description": "This is a Behavior Pack used to demo components!", 
  "name": "Demo Behavior Pack", 
  "uuid": "<UUID>", 
  "version": [ 1, 0, 0 ], 
  "min_engine_version": [1, 21, 80] 
 }, 
 "modules": [ 
  { 
   "description": "Demo Behavior Pack", 
   "type": "data", 
   "uuid": "<UUID>", 
   "version": [ 1, 0, 0 ] 
  } 
 ], 
 "dependencies": [ 
  { 
   "uuid": "<Resource Pack UUID>", 
   "version": [ 1, 0, 0 ] 
  } 
 ] 
}
```
8. Save the manifest.json file.

Now, let's create the custom block behavior JSON file in the Behavior Pack.

1. Inside the **custom_block_behavior_pack** folder, create a folder and name it **blocks**.

2. Open the **blocks** folder.

3. Inside the **blocks** folder, create a text document and name it **die.json**.

4. Open **die.json** in a text editor.

### Create the behavior custom block JSON file

In the file, you will need to define what the block is, similar to the **manifest.json** file.

1. Copy and paste the following code into your **die.json** file:

```json
{ 
  "format_version": "1.19.30", 
  "minecraft:block": { 
    "description": { 
      "identifier": "demo:die" 
    }, 
    "components": { 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

2. Save the file.

Custom block files have several requirements for them to be functional:

- **format_version** should be the latest, in case any components change in the future.

- **minecraft:block** is the block definition, which contains the "description" and "components" sections of a block.

- The **description** object requires an identifier with a namespace, separated by a colon. In this case, the namespace is "demo" and the identifier is "die".

- A **components** section contains the components that describe the block's behavior.

There are several components you may choose to use in custom blocks. To learn more, view the [full list of custom block components](../Reference/Content/BlockReference/Examples/BlockComponents/BlockComponentsList.md) in the reference documentation. For now, we'll leave the die block with only the identifier.

## Resource Pack

Now that you've set up the custom **block.json** file in the Behavior Pack, it's time to include the resources Minecraft will need to create the block: geometry, textures, names, and even a fun sound for when players place or break the block.

### Create a Resource Pack

We will begin by creating a Resource Pack for the custom block:

1. In **File Explorer**, navigate to the **com.mojang** folder.

2. Open the **development_resource_packs** folder.

3. Create a new folder named **custom_block_resource_pack**.

4. Inside the **custom_block_resource_pack** folder, create a **manifest.json** file.

5. Open the **manifest.json** file in a text editor.

6. Copy the code below into the **manifest.json** file. See the [Introduction to Behavior Packs Tutorial](./BehaviorPack.md) to learn how to use UUIDs to create the dependency of this Behavior Pack on the Resource Pack, and get any new UUIDs from UUIDgenerator.net.

```json
{ 
 "format_version": 2, 
 "header": { 
  "description": "This is a Resource Pack used to demo components!", 
  "name": "Demo Resource Pack", 
  "uuid": "<UUID>", 
  "version": [ 1, 0, 0 ], 
  "min_engine_version": [1, 21, 80] 
 }, 
 "modules": [ 
  { 
   "description": "Demo Resource Pack", 
   "type": "resources", 
   "uuid": "<UUID>", 
   "version": [ 1, 0, 0 ] 
  } 
 ] 
} 
```
7. Save the manifest.json file.

### Set the block name with .lang

Let's add the name of the block using a **.lang** file&mdash;a file that's used to organize all the custom text in an add-on and to localize creator content.

1. Inside the **custom_block_resource_pack** folder, create a folder and name it **texts**.

2. Open **texts** and create a new text document called **en_US.lang**.

3. Open **en_US.lang** in a text editor.

4. Copy and paste the following into **en_US.lang**: `tile.demo:die.name=Die`

5. Save and close the **.lang** file.

This piece of code sets the name of the block to `Die` in the game.

### Save the custom block textures

The die block texture still needs to be created and placed in your Resource Pack. When creating your own custom textures, make sure they are 16x16 for custom blocks that use a standard block geometry (`geometry.full_block`).

These were made in Paint and are 16x16 pixels. Notice that there are 7 images, because it's a 6-sided die block that also has a unique in-hand texture.

The image that shows the 1 side should be named **die_1**, 2 should be named **die_2**, and so on. The in-hand image should be named **die_red**.

:::image type="content" source="Media/AddCustomDieBlock/AddCustomBlock3.png" alt-text="Side 1 of 7 die sides.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AddCustomDieBlock/AddCustomBlock4.png" alt-text="Side 2 of 7 die sides.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AddCustomDieBlock/AddCustomBlock5.png" alt-text="Side 3 of 7 die sides.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AddCustomDieBlock/AddCustomBlock8.png" alt-text="Side 6 of 7 die sides.":::

:::image type="content" source="Media/AddCustomDieBlock/AddCustomBlock9.png" alt-text="Side 7 of 7 die sides.":::

>[!Note]
> The images above have been provided for the die block tutorial, but feel free to use different textures to further customize your die block. If you do, just be careful to keep naming consistent throughout the tutorial!

If you're using the resources provided:

1. Download the `.png` files to your computer.

2. Navigate to **custom_block_resource_pack** and create a folder inside named **textures**.

3. Inside the **textures** folder, create a folder named **blocks**.

4. Place the die block `.png` files in the **blocks** folder.

### Add a friendly name in terrain_texture.json

The next step is to associate the texture names with a texture file path. This is done in a **terrain_texture.json** file.

1. In **File Explorer**, navigate to the **custom_block_resource_pack** folder and open the **textures** folder.

2. Inside the **textures** folder, create a text document and name it **terrain_texture.json**.

3. Open **terrain_texture.json** in a text editor.

4. Copy and paste the following code:

```json
{ 
  "resource_pack_name": "custom_block_resource_pack", 
  "texture_name": "atlas.terrain", 
  "padding": 8, 
  "num_mip_levels": 4, 
  "texture_data": { 
    "die_1": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_1" 
    }, 
    "die_2": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_2" 
    }, 
    "die_3": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_3" 
    }, 
    "die_4": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_4" 
    }, 
    "die_5": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_5" 
    }, 
    "die_6": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_6" 
    }, 
    "die_red": { 
      "textures": "textures/blocks/die_red" 
    } 
  } 
} 
```

5. Save the file.

In `texture_data`, the object with the label `die_1` has created a friendly name we'll reference in other files. Cool!

### Define sounds with blocks.json

Block definitions are handled differently in the Resource Pack. Blocks are stored in a single JSON file that will contain definitions for each custom block.

1. Open the **development_resource_packs** folder.

2. Open the **custom_block_resource_pack** folder.

3. Inside **custom_block_resource_pack**, create a text document and name it **blocks.json**.

4. Open **blocks.json** in a text editor.

The **blocks.json** file has a similar set up to the **manifest.json** file and has requirements that need to be met in order for it to work correctly. Those requirements are:

- A format version
- A namespaced name for our custom block (here, it's `demo:die`)

Because this is a hard block, we're setting the sound to `stone` so that this block sounds like a stone when you place it down or walk over it.

5. Copy the following text and paste it into your **blocks.json** file:

```json
{ 
  "format_version": "1.19.30", 
  "demo:die": {
    "sound": "stone" 
     } 
}
```

6. Save the file.

### Define the block geometry

From Minecraft: Bedrock Edition v1.21.80 and onward, all custom blocks need their geometry explicitly defined to prevent your Resource Pack from conflicting with vanilla block values. Two basic geometries are available out of the box, but you can always create your own custom geometries with the [Blockbench Entity Wizard](./MinecraftEntityWizard.md) if those don't work for you. For this tutorial, we'll be using `minecraft:geometry.full_block`&mdash;the out of the box geometry for a basic cube.

We'll be using a `material_instances` component to specify the die textures individually by face with the friendly texture names we assigned in **terrain_textures.json**. Consult our [Reference Documentation](../Reference/Content/BlockReference/Examples/BlockComponents/minecraftBlock_material_instances.md) for more information on the `material_instances` component. 

Textures can be specified as a string, or as an object with the textures broken down into sub-textures. We'll define sub-textures here as `up`, `down`, and the four cardinal directions to give each face a specific texture.

> [!Note]
> Real-life dice are designed so that the two opposite sides of the die add up to 7.

The `item_visual` component lets you specify the texture(s) to use when the die block is in your hand, hotbar, and inventory. We're giving that the `die_red` texture here as a string, but this could also be given an object to specify a texture for each face, too. Check out our [Block Components Reference Documentation](../Reference/Content/BlockReference/Examples/BlockComponents/minecraftBlock_item_visual.md) for a complete list of Item Visual properties.

1. From the File Explorer, navigate to the **custom_block_behavior_pack** folder you created earlier.

2. Open the **blocks** folder you created there.

3. Open **die.json** in a text editor.

4. Replace the content you added earlier with the content below.

```json
{ 
  "format_version": "1.21.80", 
  "minecraft:block": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "demo:die"
    },
    "components": {
      "minecraft:geometry": "minecraft:geometry.full_block",
      "minecraft:material_instances": {
        "north": {
          "texture": "die_3"
        },
        "south": {
          "texture": "die_4"
        },
        "east": {
          "texture": "die_2"
        },
        "west": {
          "texture": "die_5"
        },
        "up": {
          "texture": "die_1"
        },
        "down": {
          "texture": "die_6"
        }
      },
      "minecraft:item_visual": {
      "geometry": "minecraft:geometry.full_block",
      "material_instances": {
        "*": {
          "texture": "die_red",
          "render_method": "opaque"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
} 
```


## Test the block

With the die block defined in both the Behavior Pack and Resource Pack, you're ready to test it in-game!

### Create a test world

The following are suggested settings for a test world, but feel free to tweak these as you see fit.

- Flat world

- Show coordinates

- Cheats enabled

- Always day

- Keep inventory

- No mob spawning

- No weather cycle

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You will need to have a Minecraft world where cheats are enabled in order to add the block to your inventory using the `/give` command. You will also need to have both **custom_block_resource_pack** and **custom_block_behavior_pack** enabled in the world so you can get access to the die block.

1. Open the chat box.

2. Type the following command: `/give @s demo:die`

## Troubleshooting

1. If there's no custom block Resource Pack or Behavior Pack:
    - Do you have a manifest file?
    - Does your file structure match the minecraft-samples packs?
    - Have you created a world with cheats enabled?
    - Are you using Minecraft: Bedrock Edition version 1.19.20 or later?

2. If the `demo:die` doesn't appear in the game:
    - Is your Behavior Pack formatted correctly?

3. If your textures don't load correctly:
    - Do your textures and **terrain_texture.json** file match the **custom_block_resource_pack** samples?

Now place your block anywhere you'd like. The die is red in hand and in the hotbar because of the **carried_textures** using the red die block. The sides will look like a colorful die when the block is placed, and walking on the block will use the **stone** sound.

Good luck!
