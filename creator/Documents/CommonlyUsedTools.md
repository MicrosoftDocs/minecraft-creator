### Requirements

Itâ€™s recommended that the following be completed before beginning this tutorial before using tools that convert between Minecraft editions.

- [Differences Between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition](DifferencesBetweenBedrockAndJava.md)

## Creating maps

Map creation is one of the largest and most time-consuming components of content creation. That being said, there are a significant number of map creation tools available to make this process significantly more efficient.

### [Chunker](https://chunker.app/)

Chunker is a web tool for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition worlds. It's specifically useful for converting worlds between Minecraft: Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, as well as easily configuring world settings. Conversion includes level settings, chunk data (such as blocks and biomes), dimensions, and more. To learn more about using Chunker, you can begin with the [Chunker Overview](ChunkerOverview.md) guide, which goes over the steps needed to do simple conversions and leads to more advanced features of the tool.

### [WorldPainter](https://www.worldpainter.net/)

World Painter is an application for Java Edition that allows creators to create custom worlds using tools similar to a traditional painting application. It includes features such as sculpting and molding terrain, as well as the ability to paint in materials such as snow and ice, or entire builds like trees and houses. WorldPainter saves custom worlds in the Java Edition world format and would need to be converted to Bedrock Edition-compatible worlds before they can be used in Bedrock Edition.

### [Amulet](https://www.amuletmc.com/)

Amulet is a utility tool designed to edit Minecraft maps. It can come in handy for world development, having helpful abilities such as replacing blocks in a selected area and the ability to create and remove chunks within a world. There's also a massive variety of community-made custom plugins referred to as "operations" that allow creators to perform a wide variety of tasks. Included below is a list of operations that can be useful for map creation:

- [Abrightmore's Amulet operations](https://github.com/abrightmoore/Amulet-Editor-Operations)

## NBT Editors

NBT tags are the properties of objects like entities, blocks, dimensions and players. They store data about the object - its position, inventory, the dimension it is in, how the game should call it, what it has in his armor slots, if it has a name tag and a lot more. They can be edited for many purposes, for example, giving an entity an item that it can use, or give it a `minecraft:npc` tag to make it interactable. They can be edited for map making purposes, or testing your addons.
NBT Editors are programs which help you edit the NBT tags of an object in a Minecraft world.
Here is a list of popular NBT Editors which will help you to edit NBT tags efficiently.

### [MCC Tool Chest](https://mcctoolchest.weebly.com)

MCC Tool Chest is a powerful and efficient NBT Editor which has many options for editing in a GUI environment. Some of the things it can do is merge maps(worlds), edit maps(items), edit the flat-world layers. You can learn more at the [Tutorials Page](https://mcctoolchest.weebly.com/tutorial.html). It supports many world platforms - Bedrock Edition(Windows10, Phones, iOS, Xbox One, Playstation 4/5, etc), Java Edition(Windows, Mac and Linux), Legacy Console Editions(Wii U Edition, Xbox 360 Edition, PS3 Edition.

### [Universal Minecraft Editor](https://www.universalminecrafteditor.com)

and Graphical Layer Editing. The only upside is that it is updated frequently.

## Server Based Tools

Many commonly used tools are designed to be used on Java Edition servers utilizing a server software known as [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), which is based on the Craftbukkit API. The following tools are plugins that work on servers running this software.

This is especially useful when creating large builds with lots of repeating patterns. Linked here is the Fast Async WorldEdit project, a spinoff that includes some big performance boosts from the [original WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit), as well as some useful features for creative builders.

## What's Next?

While there are many more tools that exist and are constantly being created to make Minecraft content creation easier, this is a great place to start. Creators should check back here often for newly added content and take advantage of all the available tools at their disposal.

Some of these tools allow you to modify NBT data. Learning about NBT and especially learning what *not* to do when editing it will save you from a world of trouble.
