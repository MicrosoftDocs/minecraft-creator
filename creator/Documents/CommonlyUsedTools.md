## Server Based Tools

Many commonly used tools are designed to be used on Java Edition servers utilizing a server software known as [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), which is based on the Craftbukkit API. The following tools are plugins that work on servers running this software.

Some notable features include the ability to copy and paste selected areas, as well as rotate selected areas to face a different direction. This is especially useful when creating large builds with lots of repeating patterns. Linked here is the Fast Async WorldEdit project, a spinoff that includes some big performance boosts from the [original WorldEdit](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/worldedit), as well as some useful features for creative builders.

## What's Next?

While there are many more tools that exist and are constantly being created to make Minecraft content creation easier, this is a great place to start. Creators should check back here often for newly added content and take advantage of all the available tools at their disposal.

Some of these tools allow you to modify NBT data. Learning about NBT and especially learning what *not* to do when editing it will save you from a world of trouble.
