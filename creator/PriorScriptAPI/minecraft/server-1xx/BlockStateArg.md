# BlockStateArg Type Alias (Version 1.x.x)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation is for an older version of this module. Go to the latest documentation [*here*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server/BlockStateArg.md).

Type alias used by the [*@minecraft/server.BlockPermutation*](../../../priorscriptapi/minecraft/server-1xx/BlockPermutation.md) matches and resolve functions to narrow block state argument types to those mapped by {@link @minecraft/vanilla-data.BlockStateMapping}.

## Declaration
`export type BlockStateArg<T> = T extends `${minecraftvanilladata.MinecraftBlockTypes}` ? T extends keyof minecraftvanilladata.BlockStateMapping ? minecraftvanilladata.BlockStateMapping[T] : never : Record<string, boolean | number | string>;`
