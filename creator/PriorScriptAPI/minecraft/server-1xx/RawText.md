# RawText Interface (Version 1.x.x)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation is for an older version of this module. Go to the latest documentation [*here*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server/RawText.md).

A `RawMessage` with only the `rawtext` property. When a `RawMessage` is serialized the contents are put into a rawtext property, so this is useful when reading saved RawMessages. See `BlockSignComponent.setText` and `BlockSignComponent.getRawText` for examples.

## Properties

### **rawtext**
`rawtext?: RawMessage[];`

A serialization of the current value of an associated sign.

Type: [*RawMessage*](RawMessage.md)[]
