# `/script` Command

Comprehensive debugging, profiling, and diagnostics tools for script development in Minecraft. The script command provides access to debugger connections, performance profiling, and advanced diagnostics capture capabilities.

## Usage

### Debugger Connection Management

#### Start debugger listener

`/script debugger listen <port: int>`

Start a debugger listener on the specified port. This allows Visual Studio Code or other debugging clients to connect to the server for script debugging sessions.

#### Connect to external debugger

`/script debugger connect [host: string] [port: int]`

Connect to an external debugger host. If no host is specified, the value defaults to `localhost`. If no port is specified, the default debugging port is selected.

#### Close debugger connection

`/script debugger close`

Close the current debugger connection and stop debugging session.

### Performance Profiling

#### Start performance profiler

`/script profiler start`

Begin a performance profiling session that tracks function call times, memory usage, and execution patterns. Run this before exercising the code you want to analyze.

#### Stop performance profiler

`/script profiler stop`

Stop the performance profiling session and generate a .cpuprofile file in the Minecraft logs directory. This file can be opened in Visual Studio Code for detailed performance analysis.

### Advanced Diagnostics

#### Start comprehensive diagnostics capture

`/script diagnostics startcapture`

Begin capturing comprehensive diagnostics information including memory usage, execution timing, API call patterns, and runtime behavior. This provides more detailed information than the profiler alone.

#### Stop diagnostics capture

`/script diagnostics stopcapture`

End the diagnostics capture session and save the diagnostic data. This information can be used for in-depth analysis of script behavior and performance optimization.

## Output Files and Analysis

### Profiler Output

When using `/script profiler stop`, a **.cpuprofile** file is generated in the Minecraft logs directory:

- **Retail Minecraft**: `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\logs\`
- **Minecraft Preview**: `%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftWindowsBeta_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\logs\`

These **.cpuprofile** files can be opened directly in Visual Studio Code for detailed performance analysis, including function call trees, timing data, and performance bottlenecks.

### Diagnostics Output

Diagnostic capture sessions generate comprehensive data files that include:

- Memory usage patterns and allocations
- Script execution timing and performance metrics
- API call frequency and patterns
- Runtime behavior and watchdog statistics
