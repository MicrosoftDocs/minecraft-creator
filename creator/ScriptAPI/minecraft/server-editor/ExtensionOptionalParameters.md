### **notes**
`notes?: string;`

Optional notes for the extension being registered.  

This can be a straight textual description or a string identifier key for a localized string in the extension's resource pack text files.

The notes section is meant to convey more detailed information and notes (e.g. a link to the author's website)

The length of this string is capped to 1024 characters

Type: *string*

### **toolGroupId**
`toolGroupId?: string;`

An optional custom identifier that will be used for all Modal Tools created from the registered extension.
