# ISimpleToolPaneOptions Interface

A set of options which define the basic properties of a window pane (or sub-pane) for a simple tool. This pane can be a top level pane, or a child pane of the top level pane, and is the content container for all of the UI controls used by the editor tool. Each pane is uniquely identified by the `id` property, and has a number of optional function closures which are called at various points in the pane's lifecycle. Note that instead of having a single `onFinalize` function, panes implement a pair of `onBeginFinalize` and `onEndFinalize` functions. This is to allow for the pane to be partially constructed BEFORE any child panes are constructed. Once all child panes have been fully finalized, then the `onEndFinalize` function is called to allow the pane to finalize itself.

## Properties

### **childPaneInitiallyVisible**
`childPaneInitiallyVisible: string;`

The id of the child pane that should be visible when the parent pane is first shown, or the editor tool is constructed and finalized

Type: *string*

### **childPanes**
`childPanes: ISimpleToolPaneOptions[];`

An optional array of child panes. These panes are set up exactly the same as the top level pane, but are displayed as children inside the parent pane.

Type: *ISimpleToolPaneOptions[]*

### **childPanesMutuallyExclusive**
`childPanesMutuallyExclusive: boolean;`

An optional flag to indicate whether the child panes are mutually exclusive. If this is true, then only one child pane can be visible at a time. If this is false, then multiple child panes can be visible at the same time. Visibility is controlled either through `showPane` or `hidePane` functions of the `ISimpleToolPaneComponent` or through the visibility methods in the top level tool (`ISimpleTool`)

Type: *boolean*

### **id**
`id: string;`

The unique identifier for this pane. This is used to identify the pane in the tool's pane hierarchy.

Type: *string*

### **infoTooltip**
`infoTooltip: TooltipInteractiveContent;`

Information tooltip displayed on the root pane header.

Type: *TooltipInteractiveContent*

### **onBeginFinalize**
`onBeginFinalize: (pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void;`

Type: *(pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void*

### **onEndFinalize**
`onEndFinalize: (pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void;`

Type: *(pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void*

### **onHide**
`onHide: (pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void;`

Type: *(pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void*

### **onShow**
`onShow: (pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void;`

Type: *(pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void*

### **onTeardown**
`onTeardown: (pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void;`

Type: *(pane: ISimpleToolPaneComponent) => void*

### **title**
