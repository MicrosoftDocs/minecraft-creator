# Extension Class

Editor Extensions are the basis for all player specific, editor specific functionality within the game.  Almost all editor functionality is exported and available within the context of an [*@minecraft/server-editor.ExtensionContext*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server-editor/ExtensionContext.md)

When the script manager initializes during level loading, the scripts are loaded from the behavior packs and executed.  As part of the global execution context, the scripts are free to register any number of extensions.

An Editor Extension is defined a name, an activation function and a shutdown function.



It is not recommended to directly use this function as the contract is not guaranteed to be stable, instead prefer [*@minecraft/server-editor.registerEditorExtension*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server-editor/minecraft-server-editor.md#registereditorextension) as it provides additional functionality and a stable contract.
