# AdminBeforeEvents Class

## Properties

### **asyncPlayerJoin**
`read-only asyncPlayerJoin: AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEventSignal;`

This event is fired before a player joins the world. Unlike other before events, this event is a before event that you can delay several ticks by not resolving the promise returned in the subscribe function. If the promise is rejected, the client is rejected.

Type: [*AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEventSignal*](AsyncPlayerJoinBeforeEventSignal.md)
