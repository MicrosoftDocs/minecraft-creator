# BoundingBox Interface

> [!CAUTION]
> This interface is still in pre-release.  Its signature may change or it may be removed in future releases.

A BoundingBox is an interface to an object which represents an AABB aligned rectangle.  

The BoundingBox assumes that it was created in a valid state (min <= max) but cannot guarantee it (unless it was created using the associated [*@minecraft/server.BoundingBoxUtils*](../../minecraft/server/BoundingBoxUtils.md) utility functions.

The min/max coordinates represent the diametrically opposite corners of the rectangle.

The BoundingBox is not a representation of blocks - it has no association with any type, it is just a mathematical construct - so a rectangle with

( 0,0,0 ) -> ( 0,0,0 )

has a size of ( 0,0,0 ) (unlike the very similar [*@minecraft/server.BlockVolume*](../../minecraft/server/BlockVolume.md) object)

## Properties

### **max**
`max: Vector3;`

A [*@minecraft/server.Vector3*](../../minecraft/server/Vector3.md) that represents the largest corner of the rectangle

Type: [*Vector3*](Vector3.md)

### **min**
`min: Vector3;`

A [*@minecraft/server.Vector3*](../../minecraft/server/Vector3.md) that represents the smallest corner of the rectangle

Type: [*Vector3*](Vector3.md)
