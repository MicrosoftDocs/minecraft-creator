# InputButton Enumeration

All the different input buttons that are supported. Use with [*@minecraft/server.InputInfo.getButtonState*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server/InputInfo.md#getbuttonstate) via [*@minecraft/server.Player.inputInfo*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server/Player.md#inputinfo) or [*@minecraft/server.PlayerButtonInputAfterEvent*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server/PlayerButtonInputAfterEvent.md) via [*@minecraft/server.WorldAfterEvents.playerButtonInput*](../../../scriptapi/minecraft/server/WorldAfterEvents.md#playerbuttoninput)

## Constants
### **Jump**
`Jump = "Jump"`

This is mapped to the 'Jump' button on controllers, keyboards, and touch interfaces.
### **Sneak**
`Sneak = "Sneak"`

This is mapped to the 'Sneak' button on controllers, keyboards, and touch interfaces. By default, this is shift on a keyboard or B on an Xbox controller. On touch interfaces this will only be pressed for 1 tick or less and then it will be released immediately even if the player holds their finger down. Dismounting a horse or exiting a boat will not send a Sneak button change event.
