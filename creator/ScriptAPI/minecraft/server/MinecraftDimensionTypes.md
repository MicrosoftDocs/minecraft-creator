# MinecraftDimensionTypes Class

A collection of default Minecraft dimension types.

## Constants

### **nether**
`static read-only nether = "minecraft:nether";`

The Nether is a collection of biomes separate from the Overworld, including Soul Sand Valleys and Crimson forests. Nether fortresses contain exclusive resources. Mobs such as Blaze, Hoglins, Piglins, and Ghasts congregate here.

Type: *string*

### **overworld**
`static read-only overworld = "minecraft:overworld";`

The overworld is a collection of biomes, including forests, plains, jungles, mountains, deserts, taiga, and more. This is the default starter dimension for Minecraft. Mobs such as Axolotl, Cows, Creepers, and Zombies congregate here.

Type: *string*

### **theEnd**
`static read-only theEnd = "minecraft:the_end";`

The End is separate from the Overworld and the Nether and is generated whenever you create an End portal. Here, a giant center island is surrounded by several smaller areas and islands. You can find Endermen here. End midlands are larger areas that transition you from the center to the outer edges of the End. They contain Shulkers, Endermen, End gateway portals, and End cities. End gateway portals are commonly found at the outermost edge of the void. You usually find End barrens toward the edges of the main areas or land in the End.
