# ChatSendBeforeEventSignal Class

> [!CAUTION]
> This class is still in pre-release.  Its signature may change or it may be removed in future releases.

Manages callbacks that are connected to an event that fires before chat messages are sent.

## Methods
- [subscribe](#subscribe)
- [unsubscribe](#unsubscribe)

### **subscribe**
`
subscribe(callback: (arg0: ChatSendBeforeEvent) => void): (arg0: ChatSendBeforeEvent) => void
`

Adds a callback that will be called before new chat messages are sent.

#### **Parameters**
- **callback**: (arg0: [*ChatSendBeforeEvent*](ChatSendBeforeEvent.md)) => *void*
  This closure is called with restricted-execution privilege.

**Returns** (arg0: [*ChatSendBeforeEvent*](ChatSendBeforeEvent.md)) => *void*
  The returned closure is called with restricted-execution privilege.
  
Notes:
- This function can't be called in restricted-execution mode.
- This function can be called in early-execution mode.

### **unsubscribe**
`
unsubscribe(callback: (arg0: ChatSendBeforeEvent) => void): void
`

Removes a callback from being called before new chat messages are sent.

#### **Parameters**
- **callback**: (arg0: [*ChatSendBeforeEvent*](ChatSendBeforeEvent.md)) => *void*
  This closure is called with restricted-execution privilege.
  
Notes:
- This function can't be called in restricted-execution mode.
- This function can be called in early-execution mode.

#### Examples

##### ***customCommand.ts***

```typescript
import { world, DimensionLocation } from "@minecraft/server";

function customCommand(targetLocation: DimensionLocation) {
  const chatCallback = world.beforeEvents.chatSend.subscribe((eventData) => {
    if (eventData.message.includes("cancel")) {
      // Cancel event if the message contains "cancel"
      eventData.cancel = true;
    } else {
      const args = eventData.message.split(" ");

      if (args.length > 0) {
        switch (args[0].toLowerCase()) {
          case "echo":
            // Send a modified version of chat message
            world.sendMessage(`Echo '${eventData.message.substring(4).trim()}'`);
            break;
          case "help":
            world.sendMessage(`Available commands: echo <message>`);
            break;
        }
      }
    }
  });
}
```
