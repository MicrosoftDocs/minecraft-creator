# LootPoolTiers Class

> [!CAUTION]
> This class is still in pre-release.  Its signature may change or it may be removed in future releases.

Represents the values which determine loot drops in a tiered loot pool. Potential drops from tiered loot pools are ordered, and chosen via logic controlled by the values in this object.

## Properties

### **bonusChance**
`read-only bonusChance: number;`

The chance for each bonus roll attempt to upgrade the tier of the dropped item.

Type: *number*

### **bonusRolls**
`read-only bonusRolls: number;`

The number of attempts for the loot drop to upgrade its tier, thereby incrementing its position in the loot pool entry array, resulting in a higher tier drop.

Type: *number*

### **initialRange**
`read-only initialRange: number;`

Represents the upper bound for the starting point in determining which tier of loot to drop. The lower bound is always 1. For example, a value of 3 would result in the tier drop logic starting at a randomly selected position in the loot pool entry array between 1 and 3.

Type: *number*
