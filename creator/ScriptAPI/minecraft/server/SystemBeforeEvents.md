# SystemBeforeEvents Class

> [!CAUTION]
> This class is still in pre-release.  Its signature may change or it may be removed in future releases.

A set of events that fire before an actual action occurs. In most cases, you can potentially cancel or modify the impending event. Note that in before events any APIs that modify gameplay state will not function and will throw an error.

## Properties

### **shutdown**
`read-only shutdown: ShutdownBeforeEventSignal;`

Type: [*ShutdownBeforeEventSignal*](ShutdownBeforeEventSignal.md)

### **startup**
`read-only startup: StartupBeforeEventSignal;`

Type: [*StartupBeforeEventSignal*](StartupBeforeEventSignal.md)

### **watchdogTerminate**
`read-only watchdogTerminate: WatchdogTerminateBeforeEventSignal;`

Fires when the scripting watchdog shuts down the server. The can be due to using too much memory, or by causing significant slowdown or hang.

To prevent shutdown, set the event's cancel property to true.

Type: [*WatchdogTerminateBeforeEventSignal*](WatchdogTerminateBeforeEventSignal.md)
