  targetLocation: DimensionLocation
) {
  // register a new function that is called when a new entity is created.
  world.afterEvents.entitySpawn.subscribe((entityEvent: EntitySpawnAfterEvent) => {
    if (entityEvent && entityEvent.entity) {
      log(`New entity of type ${entityEvent.entity.typeId} created!`, 1);
    } else {
      log(`The entity event did not work as expected.`, -1);
    }
