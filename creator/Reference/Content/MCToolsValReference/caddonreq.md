| 101 | In a cooperative Add-On, there should not be any 'loose files' - e.g., <pack>/entities/this_is_a_loose_file.json - inside of a folder. | 
| 102 | Creator folders - e.g., <pack>/entities/<custom folder name> - should not be a 'common' name. It should probably be in the form <creator_short_name>_<game_shortName>. See attached list of creator names. |
