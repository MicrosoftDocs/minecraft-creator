# Entity Documentation - minecraft:body_rotation_axis_aligned

Causes the entity's body to automatically rotate to align with the nearest cardinal direction based on its current facing direction.
Combining this with the "minecraft:body_rotation_blocked" component will cause the entity to align to the nearest cardinal direction and remain fixed in that orientation, regardless of future changes in its facing direction.
