# Entity Documentation - minecraft:behavior.defend_trusted_target

Allows the mob to target another mob that hurts an entity it trusts.

> [!Note]
> Requires a mob to be set to a trusted relationship in order for the behavior to work properly. The `minecraft:trust` component will set the entity state to trusted.
