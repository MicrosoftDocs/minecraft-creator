Allows an entity to jump to another random block.


## Jump To Block Behavior Properties

|Name       |Default Value |Type |Description |Example Values |
|:----------|:-------------|:----|:-----------|:------------- |
| cooldown_range | *not set* | Range of integers | Minimum and maximum cooldown time-range (positive, in seconds) between each attempted jump. | Frog: `[5,7]`, Goat: `[30,60]` | 
| forbidden_blocks | *not set* | Array of strings | Blocks that the mob can't jump to. | Frog: `["minecraft:water"]` | 
| max_velocity | 1.5 | Decimal number | The maximum velocity with which the mob can jump. | Frog: `1` | 
| minimum_distance | 2 | Integer number | The minimum distance (in blocks) from the mob to a block, in order to consider jumping to it. | Frog: `1` | 
| minimum_path_length | 5 | Integer number | The minimum length (in blocks) of the mobs path to a block, in order to consider jumping to it. | Frog: `2`, Goat: `8` | 
| preferred_blocks | *not set* | Array of strings | Blocks that the mob prefers jumping to. | Frog: `["minecraft:waterlily","minecraft:big_dripleaf"]` | 
| preferred_blocks_chance | 1 | Decimal number | Chance (between 0.0 and 1.0) that the mob will jump to a preferred block, if in range. Only matters if preferred blocks are defined. | Frog: `0.5` | 
| priority | *not set* | Integer number | As priority approaches 0, the priority is increased. The higher the priority, the sooner this behavior will be executed as a goal. | Frog: `10`, Goat: `8` | 
| scale_factor | 0.7 | Decimal number | The scalefactor of the bounding box of the mob while it is jumping. | Frog: `0.6` | 
| search_height | 10 | Integer number | The height (in blocks, in range [2, 15]) of the search box, centered around the mob. | Frog: `4`, Goat: `10` | 
| search_width | 8 | Integer number | The width (in blocks, in range [2, 15]) of the search box, centered around the mob. | Frog: `8`, Goat: `10` |
