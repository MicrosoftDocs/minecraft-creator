# Entity Documentation - minecraft:behavior.nearest_attackable_target

`minecraft:behavior.nearest_attackable_target` compels an entity to attack the closest target within a given subset of specific target types.

> [!NOTE]
> This behavior is a requirement for the following behaviors:
>
>- [minecraft:behavior.melee_attack](minecraftBehavior_melee_attack.md)

## Parameters

|Name |Default Value  |Type  |Description  |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
|attack_interval |0 |Integer |Time range (in seconds) between searching for an attack target, range is in (0, "attack_interval"]. Only used if "attack_interval" is greater than 0, otherwise "scan_interval" is used. |
|attack_interval_min |0 |Integer |Alias for "attack_interval"; provides the same functionality as "attack_interval". |
|attack_owner |false |Boolean |If true, this entity can attack its owner. |
|entity_types | *not set* |JSON Object |Filters which types of targets are valid for this entity. See [entity_types' definition page](../Definitions/NestedTables/entity_types.md).|
|must_reach |false |Boolean |If true, this entity requires a path to the target.|
|must_see |false |Boolean |Determines if target-validity requires this entity to be in range only, or both in range and in sight. |
|must_see_forget_duration |3.0 |Decimal |Time (in seconds) the target must not be seen by this entity to become invalid. Used only if "must_see" is true.|
|persist_time |0.0 |Decimal |Time (in seconds) this entity can continue attacking the target after the target is no longer valid. |
| priority|*not set*|Integer|The higher the priority, the sooner this behavior will be executed as a goal.|
|reevaluate_description| false| Boolean| If true, the mob will stop being targeted if it stops meeting any conditions. |
|reselect_targets |false |Boolean |Allows the attacking entity to update the nearest target, otherwise a target is only reselected after each "scan_interval" or "attack_interval". |
|scan_interval |10 |Integer |If "attack_interval" is 0 or isn't declared, then between attacks: scanning for a new target occurs every amount of ticks equal to "scan_interval", minimum value is 1. Values under 10 can affect performance. |
|set_persistent |false |Boolean |Allows the entity to be set to persist upon targeting a player. |
|target_invisible_multiplier |0.70 | Decimal |Multiplied with the target's armor coverage percentage to modify "max_dist" when detecting an invisible target.|
|target_search_height |-1.00 |Decimal |Maximum vertical target-search distance, if it's greater than the target type's "max_dist". A negative value defaults to "entity_types" greatest "max_dist". |
|target_sneak_visibility_multiplier |0.80 |Decimal |Multiplied with the target type's "max_dist" when trying to detect a sneaking target. |
|within_radius |0.0 |Decimal |Maximum distance this entity can be from the target when following it, otherwise the target becomes invalid. This value is only used if the entity doesn't declare "minecraft:follow_range".|
