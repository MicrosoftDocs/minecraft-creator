# Entity Documentation - minecraft:behavior.go_home

`minecraft:behavior.go_home` allows an entity to travel back to where it was spawned at and trigger events upon arrival.

## Parameters

| Name| Default Value| Type| Description |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| calculate_new_path_radius| 2.00| Decimal| Distance in blocks that the mob is considered close enough to the end of the current path. A new path will then be calculated to continue toward home. |
| goal_radius| 0.50| Decimal| Distance in blocks within the mob considers it has reached the goal. This is the "wiggle room" to stop the AI from bouncing back and forth trying to reach a specific spot. |
| interval| 120| Integer| A random value to determine when to randomly move somewhere. This has a 1/interval chance to choose this goal. |
| on_failed| | Trigger| Event(s) to run when this goal fails. |
| on_home| | Trigger| Event(s) to run when this mob gets home. |
| speed_multiplier| 1.0| Decimal| Movement speed multiplier of the mob when using this AI Goal. |
