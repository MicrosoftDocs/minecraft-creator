# Entity Documentation - minecraft:behavior.harvest_farm_block

`minecraft:behavior.harvest_farm_block` allows the entity to search within an area for farmland with air above it. If found, the entity will replace the air block by planting a seed item from its inventory on the farmland block. This goal requires `minecraft:inventory` and `minecraft:navigation` to execute. This goal will not execute if the entity does not have an item in its inventory.
