# Entity Documentation - minecraft:behavior.croak

Allows the entity to croak at a random time interval with configurable conditions.


## Croak Behavior Properties

|Name       |Default Value |Type |Description |Example Values |
|:----------|:-------------|:----|:-----------|:------------- |
| duration | *not set* | Range of integers | Random range in seconds after which the croaking stops. Can also be a constant. | Frog: `4.5` | 
| filters | *not set* | Minecraft filter | Conditions for the behavior to start and keep running. The interval between runs only starts after passing the filters. | Frog: `{"all_of":[{"test":"in_water","value":false},{"test":"in_lava","value":false}]}` | 
| interval | *not set* | Range of integers | Random range in seconds between runs of this behavior. Can also be a constant. | Frog: `[10,20]` | 
| priority | *not set* | Integer number | As priority approaches 0, the priority is increased. The higher the priority, the sooner this behavior will be executed as a goal. | Frog: `9` |
