# Entity Documentation - minecraft:behavior.circle_around_anchor

`minecraft:behavior.circle_around_anchor` causes an entity to circle around an anchor point placed near a point or target.


## Parameters


| Name| Default Value| Type| Description |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| angle_change| 15.0| Decimal| Number of degrees to change this entity's facing by, when the entity selects its next anchor point. |
| goal_radius| 0.5| Decimal| Maximum distance from the anchor-point in which this entity considers itself to have reached the anchor point. This is to prevent the entity from bouncing back and forth trying to reach a specific spot. |
| height_above_target_range| [ 0.0, 0.0 ]| Range [a, b]| The number of blocks above the target that the next anchor point can be set. This value is used only when the entity is tracking a target. |
| height_adjustment_chance| 0.002857| Decimal| Percent chance to determine how often to increase or decrease the current height around the anchor point. 1 = 100%. "height_change_chance" is deprecated and has been replaced with "height_adjustment_chance". |
| height_offset_range| [ 0.0, 0.0 ]| Range [a, b]| Vertical distance from the anchor point this entity must stay within, upon a successful height adjustment. |
| radius_adjustment_chance| 0.004| Decimal| Percent chance to determine how often to increase the size of the current movement radius around the anchor point. 1 = 100%. "radius_change_chance" is deprecated and has been replaced with "radius_adjustment_chance". |
| radius_change| 1.0| Decimal| The number of blocks to increase the current movement radius by, upon successful "radius_adjustment_chance". If the current radius increases over the range maximum, the current radius will be set back to the range minimum and the entity will change between clockwise and counter-clockwise movement.. |
| radius_range| [ 5.0, 15.0 ]| Range [a, b]| Horizontal distance from the anchor point this entity must stay within upon a successful radius adjustment. |
| speed_multiplier| 1.0| Decimal| Multiplies the speed at which this entity travels to its next desired position. |
