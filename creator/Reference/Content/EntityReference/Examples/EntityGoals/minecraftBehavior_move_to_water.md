Allows the mob to move back into water when on land.


## Move To Water Behavior Properties

|Name       |Default Value |Type |Description |Example Values |
|:----------|:-------------|:----|:-----------|:------------- |
| goal_radius | 0.5 | Decimal number | Distance in blocks within the mob considers it has reached the goal. This is the "wiggle room" to stop the AI from bouncing back and forth trying to reach a specific spot | Axolotl: `0.1`, Frog: `1.5` | 
| priority | *not set* | Integer number | As priority approaches 0, the priority is increased. The higher the priority, the sooner this behavior will be executed as a goal. | Axolotl: `6`, Dolphin: `1`, Frog: `3` | 
| search_count | 10 | Integer number | The number of blocks each tick that the mob will check within its search range and height for a valid block to move to. A value of 0 will have the mob check every block within range in one tick | Axolotl: `1` | 
| search_height | 1 | Integer number | Height in blocks the mob will look for water to move towards | Axolotl: `5` | 
| search_range | 0 | Integer number | The distance in blocks it will look for water to move towards | Axolotl: `16`, Dolphin: `15`, Frog: `20` | 
| speed_multiplier | 1 | Decimal number | Movement speed multiplier of the mob when using this AI Goal |  |
