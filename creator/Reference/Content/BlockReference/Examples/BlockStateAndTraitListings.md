## Block Traits

List of all Block Traits and the Block States they include.

| Block Trait| Type | Valid Values | Description |
|:----------|:---------|:----------|:--------|
| "minecraft:placement_direction"| JSON Object|  |Adds the "minecraft:cardinal_direction" and/or "minecraft:facing_direction" states and setter function to the block. The values of these states are set when the block is placed. `enabled_states` array specifies which states to enable. Must specify at least one.|
| minecraft:cardinal_direction| String| north, south, east, west| Defines the cardinal placement direction of a block. |
| minecraft:facing_direction| String| down, up, north, south, east, west | Defines all placement directions of a block. |
| y_rotation_offset| Decimal |0.0 - 360.0 | The y rotation offset to apply to the block. Must be [0.0, 90.0, 180.0, 270.0]. Default is 0, meaning if the player is facing north, the "minecraft:cardinal_direction" and/or minecraft:facing_direction state will be north. |
| "minecraft:placement_position"| PlacementPosition| | Adds the "minecraft:block_face" and/or "minecraft:vertical_half" BlockStates. The value of these state(s) are set when the block is placed. `enabled_states` array specifies which states to enable. Must specify at least one.|
| minecraft:block_face| String| down, up, north, south, east, west| Which block face the player placed the block on. |
| minecraft:vertical_half| String| bottom, top| Which vertical half of the space the block is placed in. |
