# Block Documentation - Vanilla Block Tags

This is a list of all vanilla Block tags, which can be added to a block using the [`tags:`](BlockComponents/minecraftBlock_tag.md) block component. 

Creators can make their own tags if they wish, however, only vanilla block tags can use the `"minecraft:"` namespace. 

Note: most of the earlier block tags did not have a namespace when released and still do not.
