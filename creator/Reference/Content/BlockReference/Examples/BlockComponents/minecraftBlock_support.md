# Block Components Documentation - minecraft:support

Defines the support shape of the block. Currently only allows for blocks to have the same shape as a Vanilla fence and Vanilla stair. To work with custom stairs, requires the use of `minecraft:vertical_half` and `minecraft:cardinal_direction` or `minecraft:facing_direction` which can be set through the `minecraft:placement_direction` block trait. Custom blocks without this component will default to unit cube support.
Experimental toggles required: Upcoming Creator Features.
