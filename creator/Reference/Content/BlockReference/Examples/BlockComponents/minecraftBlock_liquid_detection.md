# Block Components Documentation - minecraft:liquid_detection

The definitions for how a block behaves when detecting liquid. Only one rule definition is allowed per liquid type - if multiple are specified, the first will be used and the rest will be ignored.
Experimental toggles required: Upcoming Creator Features (in format versions before 1.21.60).

## Alternate Simple Representations

This item can also be represented as a `String`.


## Liquid Detection Properties

|Name       |Default Value |Type |Description |Example Values |
|:----------|:-------------|:----|:-----------|:------------- |
| can_contain_liquid | false | Boolean true/false | Whether this block can contain the liquid. For example, if the liquid type is `water`, this means the block can be waterlogged. |  | 
| liquid_type | water | String | The type of liquid this detection rule is for. Currently, `water` is the only supported liquid type. If this field is omitted, `water` will be the liquid type by default. |  | 
| on_liquid_touches | blocking | String | How the block reacts to flowing water. Must be one of the following options: <br>"blocking" - The default value for this field. The block stops the liquid from flowing. <br>"broken" - The block is destroyed completely. <br>"popped" - The block is destroyed and its item is spawned. <br>"no_reaction" - The block is unaffected; visually, the liquid will flow through the block. |  | 
| stops_liquid_flowing_from_direction | *not set* | Array of strings | When a block contains a liquid, controls the directions in which the liquid can't flow out from the block. Also controls the directions in which a block can stop liquid flowing into it if `no_reaction` is set for the `on_liquid_touches` field. Can be a list of the following directions: "up", "down", "north", "south", "east", "west". The default is an empty list; this means that liquid can flow out of all directions by default. |  |
