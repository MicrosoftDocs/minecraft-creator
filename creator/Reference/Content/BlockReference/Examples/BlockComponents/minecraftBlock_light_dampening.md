# Block Components Documentation - minecraft:light_dampening

The amount that light will be dampened when it passes through the block, in a range of 0-15. Higher value means the light will be dampened more. A value of 15 means fully opaque (like stone), while 0 means fully transparent (like glass). Leaves use 1, water uses 2.
