# Block Components Documentation - minecraft:loot

Specifies the path to the loot table that determines what items are dropped when the block is destroyed. The path is relative to the behavior pack's root folder (e.g., 'loot_tables/blocks/my_block.json'). Path string is limited to 256 characters. If this component is omitted, the block drops itself.

## Alternate Simple Representations

This item can also be represented as a `String`.
