# Block Documentation - minecraft:friction

`minecraft:friction` is a `decimal` property describes the friction for this block in a range of [0.1, 1.0]. Friction affects an entity's movement speed when it travels on the block. Greater value results in less friction.

## Example

```json
"minecraft:friction": 0.6
```
