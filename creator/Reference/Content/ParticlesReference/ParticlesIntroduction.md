# Introduction to Particles

Particle effects are one of the unsung heroes of Minecraft. From smoke effects to magic spells, from falling leaves to bubbles coming out of a fish's mouth&mdash;all of these effects are possible thanks to the magic of particles.

A particle effect consists of basic render parameters detailing the particle's material and texture, followed by a set of [particle and/or emitter components](./ParticleComponentList.md) which can be placed in any order.

## Naming and location

Minecraft: Bedrock Edition uses a custom JSON format for particle effects. Files are stored in the **particles** folder of a Resource Pack. Similarly to models and entities, particles are referenced by their identifier, so the file can be saved in any subfolder of the **particles** folder without having to reference it.

The particle identifier is specified at the top of the JSON file, and consists of a namespace and name, such as `sample:colored_smoke`. As with all files that utilize namespacing, `minecraft:` as a namespace is reserved for Vanilla files.

## Units

All values in particle effects use meters (blocks) and seconds as units. Velocity is stated as meters per second (m/s) and acceleration is meters per second squared (m/s&sup2;). Rotations use degrees for both rotations and trigonometric functions.

Now that we have some context, let's take a look at an actual particle. This is a flame particle, like you would find on a lit torch:

```json

{
  "format_version": "1.10.0",
  "particle_effect": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "minecraft:basic_flame_particle",
      "basic_render_parameters": {
        "material": "particles_alpha",
        "texture": "textures/particle/particles"
      }
    },
    "components": {
      "minecraft:emitter_rate_instant": {
        "num_particles": 1
      },
      "minecraft:emitter_lifetime_expression": {
        "activation_expression": 1,
        "expiration_expression": 0
      },
      "minecraft:emitter_shape_sphere": {
        "radius": 0.025,
        "direction": [ 0, 0, 0 ]
      },
      "minecraft:particle_lifetime_expression": {
        "max_lifetime": "Math.random(0.6, 2.0)"
      },
      "minecraft:particle_appearance_billboard": {
        "size": [
          "(0.1 + variable.ParticleRandom1*0.1) - (0.1 * variable.ParticleAge)",
          "(0.1 + variable.ParticleRandom1*0.1) - (0.1 * variable.ParticleAge)"
        ],
        "facing_camera_mode": "lookat_xyz",
        "uv": {
          "texture_width": 128,
          "texture_height": 128,
          "uv": [ 0, 24 ],
          "uv_size": [ 8, 8 ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

```

In this example we can see the individual aspects that make up the effect, such as the 'particles_alpha' material and the 'texture/particle/particles' texture, and the five individual components. Put all of this together, and you've got a flame particle!

Next, let's discuss some of these items in a little more detail.

## Materials

There are several material options available to determine how a particle effect handles transparency and color blending.

| Name| Description |
|:-----------|:-----------|
|particles_alpha | Pixels with an alpha of 0 will be fully transparent, colored pixels will always be opaque. |
|particles_blend | Enables color blending and transparency in colored pixels, uses a normal blend mode. |
|particles_add | Enables color blending and transparency in colored pixels, uses an additive blend mode. This mode is useful for effects that need to 'glow' in some manner. |

## Components

Particle effects are made up of a set of components. For an effect to do something, it needs a component that handles that aspect of the effect.

For example, emitters usually need to have rules for their lifetime, so the effect should have at least one lifetime component to handle lifetime duties for the emitter and its emitted particles.

A bonus benefit to this system is that new components can be added later and combined (where it makes sense, of course) to get different behaviors. For example, a particle might have a dynamic component for moving around, and after testing a collision component can be added to handle interacting with the terrain.

## Particle example pack

Examples of various stand-alone particle effect can be found in the [Particle Example Pack](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/tree/main/particles_examples_1.19). Please refer to the examples in the pack to see various ways to use the particle system.

To invoke an example particle with the examples particles pack enabled, bring up the console and type:

`/particle name x y z`

where "name" is the name of the particle effect, and `x y z` are the coordinates the particle should appear.

`/particle minecraft:example_smoke_puff ~ ~1 ~5` will create a smoke puff about 5 blocks away from the player.

`/particle minecraft:example_smoke_puff 0 5 0` will spawn a smoke puff at the origin of the world, 5 blocks up from the bottom of the world.
