# Particles Documentation - minecraft:emitter_lifetime_events_travel_distance_events

Triggers particle events when the emitter has traveled a specified distance. Useful for trail effects that change behavior—such as a projectile leaving a smoke trail that intensifies as it travels, or a mob's footsteps spawning dust particles at regular intervals as it walks.
