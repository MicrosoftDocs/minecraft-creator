# Features Documentation - Introduction to Features

Features are decorations scattered throughout the world. Things such as trees, plants, flowers, springs, ore, and coral are all features. Basically, if it isn't the terrain or an entity, it's probably a feature.

Features can be standalone or composed of multiple sub-features. In practice, most features in Minecraft are defined as a chain of two or more features. These chains typically end with features that place blocks in the world. Other feature types control flow such as conditional, sequential, or random distribution.

## JSON Format

All features must specify the version that they target via the `"format_version"` field. The remainder of the data is contained in independent JSON sub-objects for each supported feature type. These feature types define the behavior of the feature and include properties specific to that behavior. To be valid, a definition must include exactly one of these type objects. See the full feature schema below for additional details and the full list of supported feature types.

### Example

A comparison of different versions for the same feature.

**Version 1.13.0**

```json
{
  "format_version": "1.13.0",
  "minecraft:scatter_feature": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "example:scatter_flowers_feature"
    },
    "places_feature": "example:flower_feature",
    "iterations": 10,
    "scatter_chance": 50.0,
    "x": {
      "distribution": "uniform",
      "extent": [ 0, 15 ]
    },
    "y": 64,
    "z": {
      "distribution": "uniform",
      "extent": [ 0, 15 ]
    }
  }
}
```

**Version 1.21.10**

Uses "distribution" field to define the scattering settings.

```json
{
  "format_version": "1.21.10",
  "minecraft:scatter_feature": {
    "description": {
      "identifier": "example:scatter_flowers_feature"
    },
    "places_feature": "example:flower_feature",
    "distribution": {
      "iterations": 10,
      "scatter_chance": 50.0,
      "x": {
        "distribution": "uniform",
        "extent": [ 0, 15 ]
      },
      "y": 64,
      "z": {
        "distribution": "uniform",
        "extent": [ 0, 15 ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Adding Features

Features are read from JSON files in the "features" subfolder of behavior packs. 

Loading enforces one feature per file; the file name and the name of the feature must match. 

Feature names can include a namespace of the form `"namespace:feature_name"` to help distinguish them from features that may be in other behavior packs.

This namespace is not considered when matching the filename to the feature name. For example, in a file called `"my_tree_feature.json"`, both `"my_tree_feature"` and `"my_pack_name:my_tree_feature"` would be valid identifiers.

If two behavior packs define the same feature name (including namespace), then the feature from the highest pack in the stack will be used. This allows users to override base features.

### Behavior pack definition

To add features, you need to know the behavior pack structure for them.

In your behavior pack folder you will want to create a **features** folder and  **feature_rules** folder. These two folders will contain all of the required JSON files to define your features.

The `"min_engine_version"` for the pack needs to be 1.20.20.

The features system does not require a resource pack.

![Image showing the structure of a custom feature behavior pack](../../../Media/FeaturesIntroduction/custom_feature_behavior_pack_structure.png)

If you are using structures in your features that contain custom blocks or items, you will need to follow the resource pack setup that adds the dependency of a resource pack.

There are examples of structures in the [structure blocks sample behavior pack](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/blob/main/structure_blocks_sample_behavior_pack/README.md).
There's more information about behavior packs in the [Introduction to Behavior Packs](../../../../Documents/BehaviorPack.md) article.

### Full Feature Schema

The [Example Feature Schema](ExampleFeatureSchema.md) document has an example of the full feature schema.

## Attaching Features

Features must be attached to at least one biome in order to show up in the world. During world generation, biomes attempt to place their attached features chunk-by-chunk. Features can be attached via a feature rule definition.

## Feature Rules

Feature rules are separate JSON definition files found in the "feature_rules" subfolder of behavior packs. Feature rules follow the same filename rules as features. Each feature rule controls exactly one feature and serves as the root of a chain of feature data. To attach a feature to a biome with a feature rule, the "conditions" object must include the "minecraft:biome_filter" field. This is a list of filter tests that are performed on each biome to determine if the feature should be attached. Most relevant is the "has_biome_tag" test.

Biome names for use in the `tag` field can be found on the [Entity Documentation - minecraft:biome_filter](../../EntityReference/Examples/Definitions/NestedTables/biome_filter.md) page.

To control the world generation pass at which a feature rule is applied, you can set the `"placement_pass"`. Order is not guaranteed within each pass. These are the available `"placement_pass"` types:  

| Placement Pass Types|
|:-----------|
|first_pass|
|before_underground_pass|
|underground_pass|
|after_underground_pass|
|before_surface_pass|
|surface_pass|
|after_surface_pass|
|before_sky_pass|
|sky_pass|
|after_sky_pass|
|final_pass|

## Forced Features

Features attached with the second method are called "forced" or "explicit" features.

Unlike feature rules, forced features are not defined in separate JSON files. Instead, they are specified in the existing biome JSON definitions via the `"minecraft:forced_features"` component.
Like feature rules, this component includes fields that define when features should be placed ("placement_pass") and how they should be scattered ("distribution").

For more information about biome components (including the complete JSON schema), consult the [biome documentation](../../../../Documents/Biomes/BiomeOverview.md).

## Feature Samples

All currently listed features as of version 1.20.40 have been combined into a [sample pack](https://github.com/microsoft/minecraft-samples/blob/main/FeaturesSamples.mcaddon) that can be used in your world as a tutorial to further learn how the feature and feature rules work.

Additionally, check the `feature` and `feature_rules` folders of the latest [Minecraft Dedicated Server](https://www.minecraft.net/download/server/bedrock) for examples of Vanilla feature rules.
