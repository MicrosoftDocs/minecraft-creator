# Molang Documentation - minecraft:query_armor_damage_slot

Takes the armor slot index as a parameter, and returns the damage value of the requested slot. The valid values for the armor slot index are 0 (head), 1 (chest), 2 (legs), 3 (feet) and 4 (body). Support for entities other than players may be limited, as the damage value is not always available on clients.
