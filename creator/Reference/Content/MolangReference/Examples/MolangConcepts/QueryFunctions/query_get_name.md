# Molang Documentation - minecraft:query_get_name

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This type is now deprecated, and no longer in use in the latest versions of Minecraft.

Get the name of the mob if there is one, otherwise return ''. Deprecated; use `query.is_name_any` instead if possible so names can be changed later without breaking content.
