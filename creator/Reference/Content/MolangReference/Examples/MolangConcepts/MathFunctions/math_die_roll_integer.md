# Molang Documentation - minecraft:math_die_roll_integer

returns the sum of 'num' random integer numbers, each with a value from low to high`.  Note: the generated random numbers are integers like normal dice.

> [!Note]
> The difference between `math.die_roll` and `math.die_roll_integer` is that the former uses floating point and can return non-integer numbers; the latter works only with integers. If you're really trying to simulate actual dice, use `math.die_roll_integer`.
