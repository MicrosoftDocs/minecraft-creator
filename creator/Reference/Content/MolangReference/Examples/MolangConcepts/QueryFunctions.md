# Molang Documentation - Query Functions

Query Functions are operators that access a wide variety of information. They can return simple true/false values (1.0 or 0.0) or more complex data. See the list of functions below for per-query documentation. For query functions that do not take parameters, use: `query.function_name`. For query functions that do take parameters, use parentheses with commas separating the arguments like: `query.function_name(1, 2, 'three')`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The list below includes only entity queries that are live. See [Experimental Entity Queries](ExperimentalQueryFunctions.md) for experimental Molang query functions.

## Example

```json
"position": [ 0.0, "query.is_baby ? -8.0 : 0.0", "query.is_baby ? 4.0 : 0.0" ]
```

## List of Entity Queries

Listed below are the currently available Molang query functions in the latest retail build at the time of this writing. Not all query functions are available in respective Molang contexts (e.g., client-side animations vs. server-side animations); where possible, client-only Molang query functions are noted.

| query.actor_count| Returns the number of entities rendered in the last frame. |
| query.all| Requires at least 3 arguments. Evaluates the first argument, then returns 1.0 if all of the following arguments evaluate to the same value as the first. Otherwise it returns 0.0. Example: `query.all(1, variable.x, variable.y)` |
